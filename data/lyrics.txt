What are you afraid of? (What are you afraid of?)
1 2 1 2 uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the uh
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothing but an average Joe though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive, for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezing
I got a family, can't afford to cope
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love, if you can't, remember me
Dear people on earth after I die
What's the weather like?
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life
This time I'm a get it right
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, playing scenes so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not having money is all I miss
And yet these hoes that roll up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blond head bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes you got to reprimand 'er
Never understand 'er, why should I even try?
Live forever then you never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
Dear people on earth after I die
What's the weather like?
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life
This time I'm a get it right
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam, watching Paid in Full
I never had good grades in school but
Shock the world is what I came to do
I got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?I said what does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam, watching Paid in Full
I never had good grades in school but
Shock the world is what I came to do
I got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?

Yeah
Eric
Well
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
I ain't asking "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beaming
The whole team about to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter's about
And sometimes, sometimes
I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of having demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kicking me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Looking for what was looking for me
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
I ain't asking "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah they ask me what I'm smiling for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind and water
See me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swinging
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it
I was digging me a hole big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these songs I can carry you home
I'm right here when you're scared and alone
And I ain't ever in a hurry
You don't never gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it comes to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
I ain't asking "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
I ain't asking "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine,
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't Di
Caprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7 giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm bout to hand it to
The homie Michael Rock, hear what he sayin' to you
Take a trip, took a molly out a bank a populari
And the word around the city is he sittin in a Ferrari
I told my self I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party till my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her locked, and lost the key
We smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying its coming soon, but I want the real show
Give me the treatment that you getting all them heels for
The shit they payin all the bills for
Man I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm pulling bills I'm real as hell
I don't front I roll blunts and papers
Don't fuck with fakers
Your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though
You see I'm booked up til April
That's mine, thats me, I take those
You try to see some peso's than shake though
You get exactly what you paid for, stop acting like you can't go
Swagging til the ankles
I feel you baby
Hopefully I look familiar, lately
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
It seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it because
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Breaking girls hearts, sorry Miss Jackson
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
Seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it
And it won't stop til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top
I said it won't stop til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top
I'm so high what you think about that babe
On some other shit, tell 'em baby act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the morning still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to the house, and I wonder if she know

(Chorus)
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world(Verse 1:)
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, hoe hopper, super star, ask direct ...
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Pullin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomar (tomorrow)
See, money, bitches love me, designer clothes foregin cars
But, I, ain't never gonna change different city everyday you hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, they don't know shit about the game
Till I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some "I don't give a fuck" shit
Still with my homies I came up with, so celebrate the fast track ...(Chorus)
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world(Verse 2:)
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bithces of every nationality get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can't we, get it how we live
Tonight is the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin' all dressed up and they takin' off their clothes
We know your man an amateur so come party with some pros
You need something new, I know your life is gettin' old
We ain't gettin' younger so tonights the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It's the fast life, don't worry baby we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy and tomorra' you can hold me down(Chorus)
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

Yo Badmon things
But yo, we out in L.A. though man
Shout to the leakers man
Yo, check it out
The man rose, little concrete rose
Put your hands together folks, for the black roach
Bout to deliver, like stagecoach
Now I stay posting my nigga, now what's the signs
My fountain of youth is all drying
One minute we all smiling and then poof, we fall sad and then
I be digging deep for this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane or my brain and to be honest that's probably what it is
You've seen that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times you so hungry, got mad dreams wishing that it all get sunny
But for now it's money this, money that
[?], that's just sure when I lie
Even cause your homicide on the streets to NY
A little shortie asked me, what's my purpose and why
I told her "Save the Children", [?]
You said for sure that's thight, but what's the dollar signs in that
The hella fine dimes with that, ass so fat
The phantom in the Maybach, that black Mac that go (pew-pew)
That's when I said, yo chill shortie relax
Let me open your mind
Division is color-blind, it's fine the light can still shine
I consume this time, he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find
Badmon, yeah
Check it out, one time, yeah
I want my LA shit nigga
Yeah, I'm with the Leakers yeah
And I'm smoking reefer, big cheefer
Alright shouts to all my people out in LA though

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, I fuck around with amnesia, towards the over side of my leader
One day I'm a get it all cleaned up, right now I'm a dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day, picture brings back all the pain
All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost it's way
This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes
[Bridge]
And she can get me high, when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
[Hook]
I told her please don't take this back from me
This feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, owe me that, this is real but don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grown poor to last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I wonder where will I meet her, the perfect girl that I dream of
For now don't need no huge tits, I'm a cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all
She don't need a car, if love demanded now we could roll
And we drive there, save everything that we not said
I'm telling you that you hard to trust
You say you're not, got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world I need to let 'em know
[Bridge]
[Hook]

As i spend another night with out a single thing to do
Cept' writin down this music i preceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up he got some weed he bringin through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of swishers too
thats what usually happens Deserve some cool relaxin
smokin herb and laughin and curve your enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid at my crib doin regular shit, burnin 5 spliffs
I'm so high another night alone so imma poor another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone you aint gonna bring me back
so gone couldnt tell you where im at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
Well that sound mad lame
People love me they dont even know my last name
waitin at the station till its time that i can board the train
headin to the fortune fame should explore my brain
See what im thinkin bout, pour a little liquor then i drink it down
Cuz its just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro
it's just another night alone, I spend another night alone
said cuz its just another night on my own layin back as i light up my dro
it's just another night alone, I spend another night alone
I turn my phone on silent i need to get away
put on Jcool warm up and let it play
i thank god for blessing me with life every day
and to my peoples whove gone well meet at heavens gate
I've been sellin haze but im sure theres better ways
that i can get my pay I just need to get straight
Nothin left to say now its time for action
No more bullshit no more relaxin
Rappins my passion so i stay writtin
spend a couple nights in burn out all the lights in my room
Stuck in my crib like gluethats what I do it's nothin new
Cuz its just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro
it's just another night alone, I spend another night alone
said cuz its just another night on my own layin back as i light up my dro
it's just another night alone, I spend another night alone
Cuz its just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro
it's just another night alone, I spend another night alone...

Yeah
Do you feel it?
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question
Rhetorical (rhetorical)Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these primadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings
I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time "we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say
I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?Wherever my mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Yeah, can I get the little bit of reverb on my voice
I'm trying to hide from something, I just don't know what
Oh, it's not sad baby, you know
(Between heaven and hell)
Yeah, I saw a mountain, you know across the horizon
When I got there realized it was just a pile of rocks
Yeah, said God damn
I wonder if every body hope that this song is not depressing as the last one was
Heaven smelled like Nag Champas
Come here darling, ash my blunt (Smoke)
Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust (No)
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up
Rap too much, how the fuck get through the verse
I came from house parties, find a bitch and go through her purse
All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe
I met God before I ever stepped into a church and that motherfucker still owe me money
I need a religion to follow
I swear to God that I got more problems than there is bitches in Carlo
Lord have Murciélago, yeah
And I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed
To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die
My eyes same color as a cherry pie
Woah, see I'm terrified
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?
Yeah, what's with all this talk about Hell and Satan
And sleep deprevation
If this is planet Earth, than my hell's a basement
Ascension
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
What's between heaven and hell
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me
Okay, fucking tell these kids one thing, just make sure handle your business
A criminal leave no witness, and don't ever trust these bitches
What happened to your life when your house become a home
Where your children at? Where your children at?
You got two sons, all they do is fight
You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme dat
Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that
[?] can you give her that?
Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app
Yeah, smoke trees in the cab
Pittsburgh, show you where the city at
And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face
Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age
90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage
My bitch batshit crazy and that shit fascinates me
Yeah, on my tongue where the tab is and it burn like battery acid
I was in the backs of my classes by the kids having asthma attacks
Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses
Every Wonderland have a Alice
But I'm a king God can I have a chalice
I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof
Be a man, that's a challenge
Ascension
(Challenge, are you up for that challenge)
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, everybody got to have balance)
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
(Salvation, and the underworld [?] gotta keep that bitch waiting
What's between heaven and hell
(Fascinating)
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me
(And that's fascinating, please be a little patient)I ain't a doctor, could be a little patient
Yeah, be a little patient
Everything will be okay then, be a little patient
One world, one nation, done waiting
Yeah, yeah
Now I'm still sipping moonshine
We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times
Yeah, but who's high now
([?])
Talk a lot of shit but will you die now
([?])
What you gonna do when everybody die out, just go die out
Let's ride out

Look, concoction of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket
Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust
I'm iconic, naked walking in the garden and bird watching
Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope
Puffing that white smoke, get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe
Sneaky bitch stole my Rolly last night, yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes
My psychic don't know the future?
To live life, you kids might just close your computer
The street lights might blind you, though
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile
I'll be running wild
Life's a motherfuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep
A little TV money, dollars for sense of humor
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler
Coming through in the wood grain PT cruiser, stuntin'
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude
And I was raised better, say God bless you
I'm Kenny Powers, you're more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours
I'm out
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why

I never take a day off, work around the clock
My engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like aseop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin up a sweat
Cause everytime I get up on the mic I come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in something fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock guess
But now I'm rocking clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Trying to make it work out think I need more reps
Used to take the bus now the boy board jets
Cause kids got me buzzing like a fucking hornet
They say I got next, tell em that I got now
It's all Disney, boy my family proud
Make 'em say ow, make 'em say oh
The hoes that tell me yes, the same ones that tell ya no
Whoa, I ain't just an average joe,
Way above the average flow, boy my life is most dope
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek
And I ain't get away for nothing cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever
If it ain't about the dream, than it ain't about me
Gon' a couple four weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, making, musical creation
The journey that I'm facing plus the paper that I'm chasing
Got me crazy after sane with the lames I see you hating
But there's nothing that can change it, thumbs up I'm maintaining
No complaining when it's raining, I'll be in another zone
Move out my mothers home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find the difference from the ground and the floor
If we gotta fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek
And I ain't get away for nothing cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever

I never take a day off, work around the clock
my engineer gettin' paid off
rock like aseop, light the weed and take off
so high i cannot see adolf
now i got these rappers all breakin up a sweat
cause everytime i get up on the mic I come correct
and i learned it from the best, always dressed in something fresh
lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest

but now i'm rocking clothes that ain't in the stores yet
travel back in time, i'm in a vortex
trying to make it work out think i need more reps

the journey that i'm facing plus the paper that i'm chasing
got me crazy after sane with the lames i see you hating
but there's nothing that can change it, thumbs up i'm maintaining
no complaining when it's raining, i'll be in another zone
move out my mothers home to a world i call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
find the difference from the ground and the floor
if we gotta fight, i'll be down for the war
thumbs up, homie i'll be sure
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesing from cheek to cheek
and I ain't gonna wait for nothing cause that just ain't my style
life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever

Quack, quack
I'm chilling for an hour, smoking weed, watching Worldstar
Benz in the garage, probably got to drive your girl car
You ain't a rapper, my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, so now I need a bird call
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong
I'm wavy, get me some shit that you can surf on
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas homie, about to put the hurt on
Your bitch at night lie in bed, she turned on
Throw some weed, tell her burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Yea, I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Posted down for buttsex, it will be a cum fast
Sorry that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit
Gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy, I'ma drown in
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we wanna know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with
Have your little brother asking moms where the pussy is
Corruption, stuntin' at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion
Pay attention, you'll learn something
Roll that weed up, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

Blue Slide Park, 
it's Blue Slide Park man, uhhh, 
just fuckin' Blue Slide Park
Hey, I got these Ray Ban shades
kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
it seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
fans be at my pants, screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash, now
Bank account lookin' like a George Young stash house
Youngin' actin' out and topics that I rap about be very big if to politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper, 
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters, moms kinda want me, neuter
but they also want the kid to come right on they cooter
Have the music sounding better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me John Stewart
So, who you know is iller than Mac Miller and Company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's so none of ya'll can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, mother fucker.
I said run and tell your mother, mother fucker.Hold up Jerm, let me spit a second.Aye, yo I breeze past haters in the E Class quickly
in deep, did a hundred songs, and that's this week
Shit keeps going on and on
we just tryna go bananas like its Donkey Kong, Yeah
On my grind, always need to work
so I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
while the DJ's be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws prolly loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her to bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy within a regular life
except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racing a bike
Who knew, that I could turn, turn sound into something so cool
fresh kids see me I am bustin' dope moves
Comin', and soon, do a D-turn and view
Creep in your kitchen, start ea-ting your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when my knee in the room
Ooh, I switch flows switch rhythm
sick spittin', unlimited ammunition.Hey, Hey, Blue Slide Park.

We in between heaven and hell
Fuck your 9 to 5, I'd rather end up dead or in jail
American ninja to these obstacles
No stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's
Keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self contained
Superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live
You'd rather had the wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs
Don't mix it with that bullshit I'm hopin' not to join the twenty seven club
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world there's no one else but us
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
Ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made
I got brothers I don't need no friends
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chillin' smokin' weed again
I'm from the 'Burgh not the burbs
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned
We're from the 412 out to the 310
We're from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my Ps & Qs like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, I don't know
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite
Cause I'm filthy rich, I got businesses
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war ain't winnin, it just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
The bro left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left, they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess...It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Yeah
La, la, la, la
Everyday we love, love
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
And everyone want-
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
Yeah

Get caught, breaking laws
Get caught, breaking laws
Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them "shhh" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no, break the law
La, la, la
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special, I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow), turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
(Spending all your time just getting high won't drive you crazy, crazy)
I killed the game like Jeffry Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding in the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I'm probably put up in the president
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no, break the law
La, la, la

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you call twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world gone crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright[Verse 1]
Yeah alright days get mixed up
Schedules get switched up
Can't be in two places at once
So, I take a hit of the spliff that I lit up
And forget I had to be anywhere at all
God damn how the mighty will fall
They wanna see me gone
But I'm here in spite of it all
I never play along
You can keep the fear and self pity
I'd rather tell you who I am, really, yeah
This is not a wakeup call
I'm not the hotel operator
I dont owe nobody favors
I don't know how the fuck I've been around so long
Busy as an escalator in a crowded mall, uh huh
It's like, every year I realize my house too small
Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, flew planes
Live out my suitcase
Lose days like loose change
I swear my life is on Blu-ray
Welcome to doomsday
The world needs a hero and I am your Bruce Wayne
Kind of like Luke Cage
You keep on running, we keep on pushing your buttons[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you call twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world gone crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright[Verse 2]
I run around with open scissors
They taking pictures
I could lose my head, they grow instead
Gets only bigger
I put on foot in front of the other
I never settle, waste your time
Don't waste your time with water and wine
I'm turning liquid to metals
Still the same dude that used to never be sure
When I was way more insecure, and I'd feel better before
No umbrellas never could weather the storm
No sympathy for the devil, too busy building a temple
I am looking beyond, leaving them looking
Hottest to grill, I'm putting them on when I be cooking
I keep on running if I have to
Medusa never turned me to a statue, no
I keep it moving, but keep it low
You can do your thing, shit, to each their own
But you better do something
We keep on pushing your buttons[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you call twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world gone crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright

Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ayy
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night
Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in the aisle
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
This the type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a fresh beau coop, second and a third time
Left you up a verse mind
And when you hungry I can chef you up some stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate this third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night
Yeah, okay I came up where the planet was
Take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Two knives, we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music and started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved onto the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for heavens sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better
All my life...I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night
Hey now, I'm saying
My only way out is the way in
I won't stop 'til you're mine, no way
Well all my days now, they changin'
I got angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side, this time
Well, I been meanin' to tell you
You lookin' better every day
Write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain, yeah
Ooh Cinderella, don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been taking all day
Wherever you came from, wherever you going
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away
I been meanin' to tell you
You lookin' better every day
Write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain

Clarity.
Clarity.
Clarity.[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect, I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I know that we would stay together, we ain't ?
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, vove activeness
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for, I hope you found what you lookin' for[Hook]
You away take the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
Ima be waitin' for that (x2)[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Misery, you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere, your epiphany
Disconnect, from everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet, is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down, so calm me down
Everybody who can see me now is not around, choppa down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliche but I can't tell you what it means to me[Hook]
You away take the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
Ima be waitin' for that (x2)

Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture
Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture
Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though
Ain't nobody close to me
Your answers straight over G
I'll bag you like groceries
It's whatever though
Whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch
I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime
I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny, always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back
Just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move
Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture
Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture
Monster and Michael Keaton
And I'm off'in you while you sleep
And you talking but it's so cheap
And I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes and get a dream in
Is all you need
It's crazy
The colony was lost at sea getting wavy
The rawest rapper
Baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn
I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope
We holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speaking in heathens
And all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin
Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming
I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil too long it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm instagram camera shy
Samurais
Fucking up a Jerm beat
Teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride
My pockets fat I'm still looking for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation we could pantomime
Girl you could come a little closer put your hand in mine
This life a prison it's time to set you free
Watching movies in silence describing what I see
Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture
Bitches stay hating
This is Claymation
Fucked up, get away
That's a vacation
Want to get paid, who doesn't though?
I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture

Real shit, new shit

Every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'mma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
Cause you live in the mall - bills pile up
I'mma chill in the spot, with a spliff I been lifted a lot
But I'm still not high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
If there's a list to the top you could sign me up
Yeah, sign me up
Sign me up
Can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me up can't bring me up
Yeah, above ground about thirty thousand miles up
Told the bitch slow down like dial-up
Go down first and she climbing up
Wanna let me cut, tell her "line it up"
Little bit much, I'm a wild one
All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood
Ever since I came in the game they been sour
I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up

I was a nobody, now my name's on the list
Couple keys of uncut cocaine on her wrist
And I let my nuts hang on a bitch
The money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous
And it is us, elixir in my cup
These bitches want a dick to suck
And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
Came for a steak but I left with the cow
And they hate when you right though
Ain't shit change but my checking account
Mac Milly(Real shit, new shit)

And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
Came for a steak but I left with the cow
And they hate when you right though
Ain't shit change but my checking account
Mac Milly(Real shit, new shit)
Yeah I done been through it all
Every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'mma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
Cause you live in the mall - bills pile up
I'mma chill in the spot, with a spliff I been lifted a lot
But I'm still not high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
If there's a list to the top you could sign me up
Yeah, sign me up
Sign me up
Can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me up can't bring me up

My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
In my own way, I feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better
My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbor's, they more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

Where are you?
Ohhhhh-ohhh (hehehe)
Ohhhhh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh
Am I supposed to? Okay
Love
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, baby
You were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
I was on the phone, we into talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin' that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said "all you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone
You better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out
If it go straight to voice mail"
Well I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
And I'ma make your mind go crazy
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you
You get closer with me run away
All I ever know is the color gray
Your loveliness bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world
In my world, ahhhh-ahh
Ahhh-ahhhh, ahhh-ahhh

I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check
I'm a working motherfucker need a desk
I don't got a heart I don't even need a chest
I'm a mess, they be saying they up next that's a stretch
Hold your breath let me bow to the crowd shit I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table gin rummy
Have a blast have a ball have a motherfucking great time
Beast I'm a dog got a squad full of K-9s
I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check
I'mma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get
No stress running suicides don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You getting fucked by your contract what the fine print says
Told you once I told you twice, I get the Lamb it's over rice
I whip the Lamb it's overpriced, the life is good the hoes are dikes
The type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfucking fool
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a business man
I'm way too young to be this rich
I don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord can you save my soul?
How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right now
How convenient, you just tryna keep it lit right now
How convenient, screaming money over bitches right now
How convenient, bet you're feeling like the shit right now
How convenient, undefeated
Walked up in Neimans spent the sac then I'm leaving
Smoking on reefer OG reeking
Got the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer
But I'mma do the dash beat it like Tina
And I got my nina boy you better be subpoenaed
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'
Someone start a fire cause it's fucking freezing
I'm high off life give me the blunt I'm a roll it
I got hot rocks I'ma let you hold it
I was posted with the hammer y'all was telling police
Now I wrestle with racks, bitch I'm Mick Foley
Shit made me go woo like Rick Florer
I mean Ric Flair bitch boy I've been player
You a bench warmer boy I've been playing
Walked up the stairs look at my shoes like them cleaner
But I shoulda worn the other ones cause them better
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a business man
I'm way too young to be this rich
I don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord can you save my soul?
How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right not

You know it's been a minute since I been awake
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
They saying that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows
Lost track of time, I'm coming home
You know my mind, the places it goes
When it goes, when it goes
It's only a game, don't be afraid
These doors will close, and people change
One day you'll go, right now you're here
No please just hear, don't disappear
Good Morning, Baby

Hey!
And it's the best day ever...
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go
Hey, I got a...
Cup of Henny,
Joint of good,
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should.
Catch a early flight,
Hit another city,
For a concert full the fans who be fucking with me.
Countin' hundreds, fifties
Groupy hoes,
That all love to show me how they drop they booty low.
Two at once,
Thats a Menage a trois,
Watch they bras come off, have me saying LA-DE-DA.
Rock and Roll,
Living life,
Gettin' head,
Get it twice.
It feels like I've been drunk for the 11th night.
Don't know how I'm gonna wake in time to catch this flight.
All these bitches in the front row try to dress alike.
They do a lot of barking, but they never bite.
They lookin' at me like I'm gonna have some sex tonight.
And yes I might if it's alright.Cause I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip,
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip,
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much,
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love (x2)Cause first I,
Take a breathe,
Then let it out,
Hear them clap a little while, then I take my bow.
I'm on my job,
But maybe out my mind,
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time.
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment, I make it, I'll admit I'm kind of famous,
My life is like a vacation, cause day out and day in these hotels, day inns,
Travel navigation, I switch up my location.
They going without shavin', the road life's a bitch,
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I switch.
Got my money coming faster than these women I get into,
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill fool, I've been cool
I'm type of dude,
Pretty cool, kind of nice, not rude,
Cause some hoes who like my tunes,
Get front row and show their boobs.
Party every night, they worry that I'll blow the fuse,
But I'm way too young and don't know rules.Okay (Cause), I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip,
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip,
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much,
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love (x2)

Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Yeah
She do whatever she like
And that just don't seem right, yeah
Make people so mad, yeah
And want her so bad, hm, well
We was fuckin', almost missed my flight
I wasn't even trippin', I said its all right, yeah
Goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute, you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down, yeah
Well I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, tell me come back home, yeah
You don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm taking too long, I'm always taking too long
Baby we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kiss 'em ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Ooh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch it one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay
Hold me close don't hold your breath
That's really your favorite, I know

Yeah, you know I love having a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
It definitely just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets your mind be at ease
And I, noticed that, that uh, sometimes I rap with my rollie on
And sometimes I take it off
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
If you love me then I'll be down for it all
Cause I ain't seen nobody like you
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel bringing back to earth
Hi, I am sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controlling us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the ideas to cash
It's taking away my mind
And I think there is a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscious will attend to the zone
I do some shit I won't remember at all
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
If you love me then I'll be down for it all
Cause I ain't seen nobody like you
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel bringing back to earth
My eyes is open, but I'm barely afraid
They say my codeine purple
And your beauty is- aye
That view taking me away
I'm smoking on that good Cali
I'm getting higher than Hollywood
Get deeper than the valley
As you get lower, the low rider
Your favorite ghost writer
We jumping the gun, I might go over be young
Much is a one way ticket
Don't know when you will return
I need to roll me a blunt
Cause you done blew this joint
They say the stars all line up
Then they bring out the sun
Hey this a red carpet event
I'm a bring out that one, she so sophisticated
I brought her presidential rollies
I'm no longer faded, she got me sober off of conversation
I'm no longer faded, she got me sober off of conversation
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
If you love me then I'll be down for it all
Cause I ain't seen nobody like you
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel bringing back to earth

I've hung around with the best out
Smile with my chest out
Shit I've been stressed out, and thinking I'm depressed now
I just wanna go chill at Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Here for so long 'bout to start paying rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal
I'm at the grocery store, lost in the eggs aisle
10 point takedown, Alabama shakedown
Used to rap without movement beautifully awake now
Think I ain't a superhero need to check my cape out
Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now
Be safe homie
In this life and the next life
I'ma see ya
So be safe homie, be safe homie
In this life and the next life
I'ma see ya
And everything will be cooler
Maneuver away from evildoers
Gene Hackman is captain no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap staring Jack Kerouac
I have a ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts until I'm only left with half a lung
Yeah I'm here, self-claimed deity
Cryin' during the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive and on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born with the potential to leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up performing alchemy
Meditating til I'm levitating out my seat
It all started with a Pay
Pal
Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now
Be safe homie
In this life and the next life
I'ma see ya
So be safe homie, be safe homie
In this life and the next life
I'ma see ya

on't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the length around you changes try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home
I hope it's never all gone, don't think it's ever all gone
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home
I hope it's never gone, forever long...

Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah
Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturing the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back?
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep
So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back back in his private quarters
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order
All this torture, thought I had to warn you
Leave it all behind and go to California
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling
You can't fathom
My hands are ahead the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder looking down
While you're running around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead
You're always running ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you paddle like a duckling, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go, do you wanna go to the festival
You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go, do you wanna go to the festival
To the festival
Hola, Malcolm. Hey man, it's Luis man. I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album. I listened, it's good. I need to tell you, man. I tell everyone to listen to the music and it sound like they like it, man. It sound like it good. I tell my wife "I'm so proud of him." I tell my girlfriend "I'm so proud of him." And the album is good. It's so good. I cannot believe it. No one can beat you

Close your eyes
[Mac Miller - Verse 1]
Uhh
Close your eyes
So watch 'em do the macarena somewhere out in Pasadena
Love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Living, this time around I'm not kidding
I had an intuition about these women in suspicion
Got me looking at you different how a man in my position cant start slipping down these slopes
Cuz its all just
As a kid I didn't learn that but
When you were young and you were just tryna live your life and have some fun
In the world when you have yet to see how evil its become
Its hard to have a dream when you're deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
Sometimes I be feeling like a needle to these young kids
You had the world you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is
[Chorus - Iman Omari]
Stay high, don't fight what you know,
Let it become intact
Don't ever let it go
(it won't stop)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
(it won't stop)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
[Mac Miller - Verse 2]
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there aint too many times its me, myself and Irene
We stay smoking through the night
Wake up do some Tai Chi
Homie cant you see I'm chilling, please don't fuck up my chi
Yeh my jacket Y3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Balling like I'm Jordan but I'm fresh as Mars blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea we never can agree
They tell you what you know but its better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be
Still I tell 'em
Fuck what you know, I'm feeling comfortable
Just continue living life cuz enough of 'em don't
You spend your days counting every single penny, mane
Start now cuz we coming for you anyways
[Chorus]
[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning
Take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with
Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly falling
We all surely should die eventually
So whats your calling?
Oh, you left your phone behind,
Identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10%
Sold your soul
I know sold your soul and get hopeless
My focus is stared at eloping on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme
Or choking or soaking up game
I'm hoping you picked the second one
The emotion of jealousy that your holding
You're telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian
Let me see
I break you down like a pound of fire whenever your tactics are mighty clever
But even if you're Mayweather you can't fight the feeling
[Chorus]

Uh let me get, uh turkey sandwich
Uh, lettuce, tomato (bitch)My name Mac Miller, who the f-ck are you?
Well my crew too live but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I'm dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and f-cking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin' with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherf-ckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin' to be left to die
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down for all I care you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market
I got my own stickers now so literally I'm everywhere
Hundred different shoes to fill no need to cop a fresher pair
These motherf-ckers treat me like it's just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth
F-ck whose first, It's just bout who the hardest
On my own too, f-ck whose saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I'm the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I'm just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't f-ckin' know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down for all I care you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Yeah, and this is Blue Slide Park

I have a vision that had to give to subtracted limits
If everything was gone tomorrow who would miss it?
And if I packed my bags and moved away who would visit?
If you'd know what you should say who would listen?
Yea I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Something to feed off, we search for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yea it's cool, we different
Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you could feel it
Yea, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Or can you listen in?
I lose it all to show 'em I'll get rich again
But matter fact fuck that cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos and the world don't want shit from you
You don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Counting roses, daisies and daffodils, chill
Get your money (Get your money)

Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, superglue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul so shut up and listen
Give me a reason to pop
Getting' me goin' and lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not
Call me in forty so they don't need shots
I got a girl, we in love
She my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure
Last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright
I believe her, I don't question she who knows me best
I know you wouldn't either
Something happened when I see her
It's right out of a fairytale
Got some shit she goin' through it
It's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch
Go roll it and it's timeless yea

Hello I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. 
We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think "what a cute guy" and he was a cute guy. 
And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. 
One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. 
And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. 
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, 
and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. 
After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. 
A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. 
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.

[intro]
ayye, turn my beat up a bit yo.forreal, or is it gonna get louder? alright cool.[verse 1]
she keep getting played like it's recess, break her heart it's a reflex
wanna hit the beach and show her ttties down in Key West
someone leave her crying all the time, now she find me out a Kleenex
sick of dudes not giving her the respect, but really she's a genius, a CEO
tryna be on top, but woah she dont keep them clothes
she be waiting for the opportunity to be the boss
tough bitch probably would've thought she played lacross
she keep being soft with her heart broken all the time
once a money to fucking dude and falling all in love with who is nothing new
only coming through, bust a nut or two
she just need her family like the hugstable
and now she on the road, after home to take over
get rich and have the crib made over
but she gonna do the partying, with a cup full, aint gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you[chorus]
She wants diamonds, she wants gold

Well, okay
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
I pay the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine, keep to myself, taking my time
Always into some bullshit, and out of line
Driving with my eyes close, missing all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sitting pretty
Listening to Whitney and whipping it through the city yeah
Man on a mission, figure it out
Putting way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes is getting bigger, so the world is getting smaller (Smaller)
I've been getting richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up, sounded like a concert
Or a, or a monster truck, I'm tripping but I'm falling up
I always said I want it all, but it's not enough
O-kay
I'm always saying I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
I was only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt)
Feelings (Feelings)Down go the system, long live the king
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy
I give a hundred and fifty percent
'This, this shit that I'm dealing with, but wish I forget
Used to be feeling depressed,
Now that I'm living and I'm feeling obsessed
Yes, high in Jacuzzi's I been hitting the jets
I'm showing her some love she been giving me sex
Bless bless bless
Respect the outline, don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride
Why you lying? (Why you lying?)
Tell the truth and step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips, that move mountains
New crib, blue fountains
These are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it
I'm always saying I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
Hurt
Feelings

Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there[Mac Miller]
See I was 6 years old with a dream, when my mums told me I can do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It aint about the vanity, think bout whats important
The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the World's best mother
Yeah aint fair, so I'ma take care of her and her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her living how she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me cause it's...[Phonte]
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there[Mac Miller - Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey
Dear mama, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike riding in the street
That delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench
When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just wanna bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say "wassup" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you, shit
You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh
I wanna tell you momma...[Phonte]
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there

Passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran
Looking back, like you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more
Cause every time she's sad I can't console her no more
If money buy you love, then love's not enough
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance, would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray but would you pay the price to paint them white?
Might have a baby on the way, cause I been going in raw
It feels better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch
I need to feel that (love)
I need to feel that (pain)
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (rain)
I keep my head up (high)
A little fed up (lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't exist
Hieroglyphics
Pyrotechnics
Metaphysics
Telekinetics put 50k on my credit card
Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone
Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that)
Getting duckets 'til I die
While my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (go)See this a rather spooky action movie
Roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie
See a creature, ass beauty
Need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing
Posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines, those will make you change
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain
But I can't complain
Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that)
Getting duckets 'til I die
While my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (go)

Had to throw one of those in there
Uhh, this that mothafuckin' millionaire music ya feel me?
Chya
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit

Hey, so I just bought another Rolie and that shit is Goldie Hawn
Better get it before it's gone because my shop been open long
I stay smokin' on that strong, I'm smokin' on that strong
Then go and take a hand full of drugs, what the fuck is goin' on?
Bein' rich? well that's fun as hell, these bitches come like they under spells
Yo Mr. Jobs you see I'm a Mac, but I'm rollin' deep like Adele
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell
So get smart, no head starts, put a Lion on a Gazelle
You tryna to rhyme cause you idolize what I design for myself
But it's hard to find these bars of mine, so Columbine your self
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich, I get paper like grades at Cambridge
I'm best friends with my banker shit, gave her fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib I'm paintin' it, half a mil just paid for it
No thanksgiving paradin' this, but we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide cause this will be your jam
Just burn a dutch and turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn
I got that Mac with me (huh.. huh)
I got that Mac with me (huh.. huh)You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
I got that Mac with me
Yo, we never met before but there will be a mess for sure
When I was a baby my crib, was Mom's dresser drawer
Infa-red, blastin' guns, duckin' shots, another K, another tank
Another Glock, they smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks
Forget the Porsche they want your baby mother's box
And you pamper honey, word he pamper honey
And she suckin' dick for formula and Pamper money
And a real thug don't play that, laid back where the mac and the K at
Yayo turned to the straight crack, Maybach black with a gat won't say jack
I got that Mac with me 
I got that Mac with me 
I got that Mac with me 
I got that Mac with me
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
I got that Mac with me

Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of money make your boy ride down
Thinking I could probably figure out my style on a stage
Looking at a big high crowd
They go insane when I run out the stage
Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old I'ma spend my days, layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank god everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinking I'll be fine if I take my time
Working so hard I might break my spine
So all yall goin' see this face of mine

Days go by and I think that I
Maybe going crazy, maybe loose my mind
Looking at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
Got a nine sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut playing bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thang
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna loose that ring
I don't pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the games a little more flavor
Say wat up, take a flick with a hater
Throwing a deuce like see you later,
That's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it ain't a hotel, nah it ain't a hotel,

Driving in my car... [?]
Who is coming up to my car? What?
I know niggas think you white and you not bout to go in with these bars, my nigga, but that is not the truth. Word to God I take another shot of Hennessy if you don't go in right now and meet your fate right now, bruh
What the fu...Okay, okay

Okay, okay
(You's a wild motherfucker, Mac)So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can know the world is up for grabs
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag
When I was younger, I was just a little wild motherfucker
Tryna be like all the people on television
They had all the bitches that I wanted, all the cars and all the extras
Anything money could buy, they was spending millions
I was tryna get to pimping, I was tryna blow up talking demolition
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need an exorcism
I'm all by myself, got no competition
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians
You want to talk about your problems
Don't you wish the life you lived was motherfucking awesome
Don't you wish you had all the pussy, too much money you could spend
You could get away and never see your shitty life again
So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can know the world is up for grabs
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag
We never done with this shit
Here we come with that shit
I ain't stressing, I ain't worried bout nothing, don't trip
It's amazing all the shit that I be coming up with
Shit is real, tell 'em chill
Keep on bumping my shit
All my life I been a fuck up, never did anything right
That's why everyday I'm fucked up
Momma pray to Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Asking somebody to save me (Somebody save that boy)
But I'm way too motherfucking crazy (No one can save that boy)
All the kids is doing drugs (Drugs)
They just want to break the law and find someone to fuck
(They wanna find someone to fuck)
Nobody doing as they told (Little bad ass kids)
Everyone out of control (Fuck it, that's just how it is)
I'm self made, dream came true, I'm a miracle
Every time I put my dick inside a bitch, it's spiritual
Got the whip that say wealthy on my steering wheel
Brand new model bitch made me waffles and some cereal
That's what I call a good morning
Your mom work an extra job just to get you Jordans
Just so you could show up at your school looking fresh saying
"I don't know 'bout you, but me, I'm important" (I'm so gorgeous)
You got money in your pocket, you the shit
You got everything you want and bitches on your dick
Yeah, a couple grand got you feeling like the man
Everybody walking tall til they trip
They just cut the check, you had to go and cop the whip
Drive up to your ex's crib and tell her she ain't shit
There's just something about the money, make a motherfucker crazy
When I die, bury me in my Mercedes, God damn
So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can know the world is up for grabs
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag

Bumping my shit
Bumping my shit
Bumping my shit

She say she love me for these cold ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen honey, I'm feeling kinda hungry
Go to dinner with your girls can you bring something back
It's unusual that, I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waiting in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
The glory, free faller, 43 stories
Cordially setting forties, hooked up to morphine
For sure clean like bald heads
Kinda wish we would fuck more and talk less
Except, me and you a little far fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the lab
I can be there in the morning
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I just got home for the night
I'm gonna be there in the morning
And I, I need a cool bitch conversation skills
Roll blunts in the love of Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
Wanna turn to false love to go and rake the leaves
Make believe, used to dream of being Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline, but fantasies tend to die off
When you grow up quickly
The walls are the same exact color as a Tiffany box
Make a profit solving riddles on a popsicle stick
If she good, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctors trip
Mom says she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for these cold ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stash
She up late, worry, tell me hurry up home
11 Missed Calls on my phone

(Come a dancehall, mi a-go kill you with the-)Yeah
Used to wanna be a super hero
Fly around with a cape catching bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain't in the shower and I ain't getting baptised
To the good and the bad times
All the cuts, broken bones and the black eyes
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all can't tell me nothing no more
Came from the basement under that floor
Don't come close, y'all don't even know I'm the goat
Y'all don't even know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
My girl too clutch to choke (hmm)
And I ain't calling it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
I like you talking that shit, it's like this
Liquor still in my cup, get faded when I wake up
'Cause everything is too much, so what?Woke up this morning with a bright idea
Maybe I can exist forever right here
(Let it run)Okay, okay, well Imma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost 'till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well I'mma be here for a while longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost 'till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwing up shots like I don't miss
Never put a limit on the high stakes
Try to pull my card tell them "Go Fish"
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get p- (uh, oh)
Yeah I don't say nothing that I don't know
Jumping out the womb wearing Polo
Everybody wanna jump in
But I'm old school, lone wolf, take em off solo
I don't need nobody
(I don't need nobody)
I don't need to be nobody
(I don't need to be nobody)
I'm just doing my thing
Kick it at the crib I don't see nobody no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side
I'm pulling up in that new shit
You always whipping that dick ride
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (no)
Lets get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet
Feeling like they forget, I let this slide, this time
Like 25 years I've been high and no less
Shit, I know I don't guess
Rather glow I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest
Okay, okay, well I'mma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost 'till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well I'mma be here for a while longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost 'till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Already, dear
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear

Yeah, who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothing when I said my hello
Oh well, to Hell then we go
So high looking at Heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smoking dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killing that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air that thing so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama you ain't need no drama
You ain't gotta cry no more now
It'll be alright
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight it's like
When it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down
And I'm the chosen one
Looking all around what has the world become
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground
I've been getting paid
About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly
It's the life of an entertainer
I need that check, go on get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar
We just did our work and we were in it for a lot more
We were trying to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got an encore
Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies the top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die not now
You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can
Look where we at, look where we came from
When will we wake up, lost in translation
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly

Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke til we can't anymore
And keep floatin'
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some
Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snap back
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
How to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me
Passin' around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke til we can't anymore
And keep floatin'
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some
And you can pass that, we floatin' along
So much smoke we got the words high wrote in the song
Girl I try to come and make you smile, I'm gone so will you wait a while
As soon as I come home we gon' smoke and then I'll stay a while
Some people hate my style, some people love it though
And all these kids who wanna clone me, they ain't comin' close
Politicing joints, we countin' none of your votes
I'm gettin' everybody high so you can puff on ya roach
Shorty used to all these players, tell her fuck with a coach
I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke
Hey my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my times up
Hate me then they love me, tell them try to make they minds up
Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
Smokin' weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke til we can't anymore
And keep floatin'
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some

This is gonna feel real good, alright?

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come falling down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come falling down
When the night, meets the light
Turn to day
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimming a bit, but deeper in thought
Keeping my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needing it all right now when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm coming, knocking on your door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain, I'm staying so high
Put the lighter all the way up 'til we touching the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free your mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Loving how I catch you blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, waking up I open up my... eyes
Do you mind if I blow your... mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be... shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be... fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes falling down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickering hitting the right switches
I'm living this life different and missing the flight bullshitting
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delay, but I came and you're cool with it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know yourself
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I burn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like the king for a grand
I don't do nothin' that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes falling down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she's dead and there ain't no coming back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn baby, you knew that when you told me you loved me
And I told you I loved you back
But now you laying on the tile, I'm waiting for a smile
So I'll stay here for a while, when the cops come in
They're gonna have to take me away
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry
I didn't mean to do it"
Guess I'm just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So what I have to give you away
And I tell 'em, I'm sorry
I'm not a bad person
I couldn't take your pain away
I guess I'm undeserving
But if I can't have you to myself
Then your, gone
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
If you getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you're getting tired, cause you making it work
But can I kiss you just one more time
Baby lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touching mine
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbing on your back, whispering rest in peace
It's okay baby, go to sleep
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'm a stay by your side
But when the cops come in
They're gonna have to take me away
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry
I didn't mean to do it"
Guess I'm just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So what I have to give you away
And I tell 'em, I'm sorry
I'm not a bad person
I couldn't take your pain away
I guess I'm undeserving
But if I can't have you to myself
Then your, gone

When I get old, I'mma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe that we makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy, nothin' easy
One day, I'mma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
From the outside lookin' in it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me, get there at five but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a lil', go and have a lil' fun
You only young once so the hatin' that be dumb
If life a joke then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun the bread'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great no intention to the hate
Nothing changed still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude now makin' moves
It's like everythin' I do front page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it
When I get old I'mma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe that we makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy, nothin' easy
One day I'mma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
Hey, my grandpa told me one day I'll be everythin' and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gonna fall, when it rain, it pours
Dear music, you're everythin' I have now
When there's an army comin' for me I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown but who's laughin' now
My mom's cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feels great to see my family proud but
I make mistakes too, my people always tell me
"Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"They say I'm so different but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too
When I get old I'mma be real cool

Cam Erlim, is that it?
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses
Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell me come and bring a mill in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hash tag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a f-ck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques
Take it back, cook it on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything on factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall and racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, Cam Rellim, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah,
Treat em' like a bellhop
Let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy
I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swing, at the swings
I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthaf-cker stay down
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings
Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louie belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthaf-ckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swing, at the swings
I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthaf-cker stay down
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings

She sayin' fuck me, fuck me, she like it rough and that's rugby
I'm partyin' where there's drugs free, this life to live, it don't come cheap
Leave a hand print on her butt cheek, she give me head while I puff trees
I'm on drugs, she on drugs, her nose just got bloody
Sniffin' coke lines off my dick, she ridin' on that train
She crushin' down that powder, I'm puffin' on this Sour
Been fuckin' her for hours and I still ain't got my nut
You fuckin' with that molly, she ain't gon' let you bust (Blam!)
Give me some while I hit the blunt, I'm in ya spirit, let me lift it up
If daddy come, get my shit and run, he gon' see my ass, go and get his gun
You a devil bitch, let me tell you that, feel like I been to hell and back
You textin' me, addicted, you need me, you miss it
She crazy, she nasty, everyday she harass me

God damn, the sun is comin' up
That's the last time that I'm gon' be fuckin' with them drugs
Yup[Hook]
She get a bunch of money, spend it all on drugs
Mobbin' with her bitches, never fall in love
Dumpin' out that yeyo, sniffin' all it up
Go ahead and hate her, cause everybody does
God damn, that's a lucky ass bitch X4[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
She got money, drugs and freedom, blunts what she's cheefin'
She ain't got a job, but fuck it, she don't need one
Drive drunk, she swervin', tryna fuck, she's certain
Run around and stumble down, hit her head, she hurtin'
Drunk as fuck, sniffin' pills, wildin' out, tell the bitch to chill
Cup of syrup and a blunt of purp
Which one of my homie's gon' fuck her first?
She in love with drugs, that pussy get licked up
Picked up, then dicked down, bitch, tell me who rich now?
You fuckin' with the Most Dope knuckleheads
Gettin' money, fuck the feds, yeah that Stevie Wonder bread
Ain't a rookie, uh, that bitch is famous, Snooki
One thing I won't do, (what's that?) pay for pussy[Hook][Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm trippy mane, lookin' for a trippy chick
That like to get fucked up and do some trippy shit
Paper planes rolled up I call them trippy sticks
Weed, pills, and the drank (coedine) -- she with it
Juicy got money and juicy got bitches
Smoking and drinking that Charlie Sheen liquor
Up in this bitch keep two hoes with me
Poppin' them superman pills getting freaky (they freaky)
I like double D's, she like double D's
Shawty can't lose, she play on both teams
Hell in her mouth, her becky fire
Molly pills, orange juice got the bitch wired
All my hoes got money and they keep me higher
Then I line em' up for a menage-a-tois[Hook]

Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran crying to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house
So who you tryin' to dial
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now
And to the man in the hat standing looking at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say that's the jam
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down kids you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it popping like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, and have them saying Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list
Fans taking pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this[Hook] (2x)All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you're feeling that funk
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you love it like that
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands[Verse 2]H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Cause girl, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin' I'mma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write
A couple bars I might go do
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little something like this
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you're feeling that funk
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you love it like that
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands (2x)Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran crying to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house
So who you tryin' to dial
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now
And to the man in the hat standing looking at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now

Ever since a nigga had recess
Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno
Damn that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut
On this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards sponsor my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high
Still in high school but I do
Everything I will do
When I'm 25, no lie
I was young with ambition
Fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission
Went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes
Tell them all what they missing
While I watch it as it unfolds
Dodging my death
Confident kid, I was trying to grow up with the best
Watching my step
Never no college plan, found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from the Bachelor
Could've been smart
Could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like "what the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money
Back in high school none of these hoes was trying to fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets
They, they, they was looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you're 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you're 18 years and older
18 years and older
I wanna rule the world
Take care of my family and take care of my girl
Plant a couple seeds, blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older

Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights
Think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me
It's just talkin' but I know you might
Now get along, now get along, now go
You sing along, now every song you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growing old is taking time
I'm acting like I'm 8 or 9
Tryin' to move on, talking to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, you to cute for that, cute for that
I've been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language
I guess people always going through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
About how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go
I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
'Bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own
She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
Of all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me"
She said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one
I guess you don't have time
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me loose my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you"
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you keep
So you can leave a message at the beep
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
About how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go
I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
'Bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own

Don't know why thinking of him makes me smile...Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushing into love
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushing into love
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby
Cause you and me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

Come and talk shit, who the boss bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with single ladies, yea I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
By her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans
Never get no sleep, you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team
You know all about me, come and meet my team
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me
Come and meet my team
And if you see me, I'll be with my team
Got my homie Billy probably in Supreme
Jimmy or Will be selling shirts to the fans
While Tree
Jay, Clock, got you raisin' your hands
Then you got Q that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave sittin' shotty in the van
Everyone I came with travel like a gang bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex, get bootleg checks
Got all these people askin' what's next
Success and a dumb fresh life
Taking bets, you trying to lose a little money tonight
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We, invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spalding
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awnin'Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
Girls: 1, 2, 3, 4

Some people (oh woah-oh-oh)
Woah-oh-oh (uhn-nuh-unh-nuh)
Yea, people say, people-oh-oh (people-oh-oh)
Say
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking about her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
Never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more, little girl
You don't have to cry
And mend a broken heart girl if you can
Don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble can you give a hand
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you about to end it all
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top
And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself
So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more, little girl
You don't have to cry

Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like 3 years..
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this
Don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
F-ckin girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that entering my brain
All of a sudden, every legend is mentioning my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police trying to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arriving to the party in a chariot
Looking for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu
Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stacking tall: 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal
An art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's looking horny in the 4th row
I just put it in her mouth: orthodontist
Manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's trying to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talking shit? You just digging your grave
A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu
Hypothetically I'm dope, I keep incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy
For happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamine
Hotter than 110 degrees
Visually stunning
You gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about
Went down a different route, it's crucial
Life with a spoonful of sugar, yea I need my medicine
F-ckin Mary Poppins
Gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, f-ck your expectations!
I'mma be the best, have some patience....
Thought that it was great, then poof
A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu

I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
I think I might I go on and on forever
I Think his could go on and on forever
I wanna walk into the store

Places I aint been before

I think this could go on and on forever
I be riding in my car with the music all the way up
See me shining imma star take a picture see you later
Ive been up some baby shit and everytime I wake up
Gotta head back to reality but reality is greater
Than you could ever imagine you say that you pull up
But im better at rapping, forever the captain
Ill be making music out of joy stick thumbs up
Joint lit y'all get what the point is
Baby I'm here I aint going nowhere
All these haters say im faking but I really don't care
Got my teammate right beside me you know where to find me
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me cause

One day im gonna get mine too
And I think that's sometime soon

If I win or lose what the fuck I gotta prove
Ive been living out my dream everything I saw came true
Travel on a tour before screaming fans
Got a stellar reputation girl be who I am

I think this could go on and on forever

[Verse]
Everybody wanna ask, where I came from?
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'mma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies Robbin people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothing hurts
100 words coming up with what 'll have your bubble burst
We can just f-ck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, and nothing worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Being free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park cause I'm out somewhere travelin'
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mad cause been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him
Oh, he's just so talented
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a f-cking golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside
No
Hell no, haha
I wanna go back home
[Outro]
Late night can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
Cause it seems that I'm always on the move
When they gonna let me back home
Yeah
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home

Oy Vey Lyrics
One day, I'ma be so rich, that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Hey, walkin' out the crib with a smile on my face,
Super hero, utility belt tied around my waist,
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex,
Chainin' down and Key west,
Every class recess,
N-n-n-ow My pockets deeper than your v-neck,
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest,
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest,
Stay up out my beez wax,
My people like to party so I'm always where the freaks at,
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin',
The best night of your life, but we do this every weekend,
Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever,
When I spit my they gon' remember every letter like
Day in, and day out,
We tryna get this cake now,
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out,
Hey, life is good don't waste it,
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces,One day, I'ma be so rich, that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Hey, they seem surprised, with the look thats in their eyes,
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise,
I advise, homies to stay homies,
Few people you can trust, all the OG's told me,
When I was just a shawty, strummin' my guitar,
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage,
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' Playstation,
Tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation,
Hey, why you grillin' put a smile on your face bitch,
We takin' shots all around gettin' wasted,
Came along way from freestylin' in my basement,
Show some love to the people that I came with,
Cause day in and day out,
We tryna get this cake now,
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces
One day, I'ma be so rich, that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

Days, days, days
Days, days, days
Days, days
So who's that lady with a picture painted on my everything?
And what is she trying to say now?
I could probably spend my time thinking all about some better things
I've been floating for so long, think I'm ready to drown
Said I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Yeah I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down
I'm in way over my head these {days}
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)I'm sticking to deprive 'em of it all
Something beautiful to brace my fall
Gotta find a melody
Gotta guide some memories
And don't believe in what they say
A predator will find his prey
Close your eyes and run around
They comin' now to hunt you down
And open up the blinds let the light in, please
I get kind of tired of fighting
We can make love, we need to make love
Days, days
This is confusion, confusion
This confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's confusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's working
Who really has the time ?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 
'Cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging, bugging
Making something out of nothing
Yeah, as hard as it gets, cool, calm and collected
Holding my breath this, ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out of my chest
The cards are all on the table I'm calling it
Don't say it I swallow it
When living off the borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence on a line
Adding up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we going down, bet you know me now
I'm treading water I swear
If I drown I don't care
They calling for me from the shore, 
I need more
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's working
(Is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
Who really has the time 
(Is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 
'Cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging, bugging
Making something out of nothing
It feel like the weekend on the Tuesday
I can move days
Its "I got something else to do" day
Always do hate, If I do say
The D'USSE with the homies like it's Kool Aid
Me, I'm just tryna play it cool J (anyways)
Yeah, mind over matter I'm
Purer than alkaline
Bitch stuck on album time
I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit I was bugging
Miss me like you getting withdrawal 
I keep that coming, yeah
I'm treading water I know
If I start moving I flow
They nothing new it-
Just play it cool baby, just play it cool
You know, cool
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's working
Who really has the time, at all
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 
'Cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging, bugging
Making something out of nothing
Yeah, tell me you love me spin me around
Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down
You seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowing time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, running late, her car is started
Even though the only thing that she driving, a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect

Yeah, I think I'm stuck inside nostalgia
Reminded of the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you are the place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby with this piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
It's my favorite song, spin it till the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate
Things how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game cause you're a goddess
Now I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah I keep that shit gift wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No take aways, no give backs
No question, we've been through adolesence
And change of direction, yeah I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl what's on your brain? Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timing, don't you ever add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution
Keep it true, everything that I do with you
I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You don't have to protect me
We both know how it ends
I just need your presence
Wanna feel you feel me
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me

Uh, yeah, little old school shit
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend but left him home
See I got style, so yes I brag
The things I do just make them mad
Download new pics to my i
Pad
While your girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fad, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda
My name's somethin' these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, Vicky she can keep her secrets
One night only, that's how I treat this
Sleep in, bitch please, make me some breakfast
And then leave
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
You see I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
Girls audition to bring them home
See I might choose, so just go with it
Her mom adores me, dad thinks I'm a nitwit
That don't really matter, I'm a have her fall in love
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit
Got one night only, so make it quick
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit
I ain't that rich, but I got bread
To make a sandwich, get me fed
Decide right now, don't got all night
This the life, so play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

[Intro]
Yep, yep, yep, yuh, yuh, yuh[Verse 1]
I don't got a reason to lie
They gave me the key to the sky
But I'd rather open my eyes
'Cause that's what'll keep me alive
Somethin' that's easin' my mind
Please do not fuck up my day
Everybody want a headline
I don't got nothin' to say
'Cept I'm comin' back with the freshness
You know I love makin' an entrance
Now now, don't get defensive
Time is a matter of seconds (one, two, yeah)
Off to see the wizard, lead the picture, me and liquor
Evil mixture, demons clitter
Clean the whiskers, seeking Mr. Fisherman
Back on my shit again
Doin' my own dance
Feel the rhythm that's no hands
I tell ya vision like programs
Busy livin' on triple digits, young old man
Ya'll dead wrong I'm upper with the echelon
So butter when the bread long
I'm going strong till my head gone (til' my head gone)
Yeah, floatin' back up on the scene I'm sayin hello (hello)
Do my thing up on the strings like Tom Morello
I keep it movin' you'll be doin way to much
I ain't tellin' time just to tell you when it's up (yup)[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (yeah)
Yeah, one for you and one for me (yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me[Verse 2]
Yeah, I mean wow, do not touch that dial
I've waited a while, been around
Just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out (and I)
And I, and I, and I put that on my house
I'm always goin' overboard, I better swim before I drown (drown)
I'm like rubber with the bounce, hundred be the count
Drummin' loud, that's Stunner with the sounds (bang, bang, bang, bang)
I was younger, fuck around, every summer wild
Always had it jumpin' at the house
Clappin' for ya'll, I'm into havin' it all
Feelin' like Shaq with the call, stature is tall
Rollin' around with the homies, a battery pack on my dawgs
Fuck with my dawgs, havin' enough ain't a lot
Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top
It don't matter, never mind the pattern when you're takin' your shot
Yeah, enough with the bullshit, enough with the bullshit
Enough with the extras, fuck all my money, I swear I been through it
Fuck all the losin', that's just an illusion
Gotta keep them comin' back for more to keep it movin'[Outro]
I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (yeah)
Yeah, one for you and one for me (yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (love for me)
Follow me another way
Yeah, you know you better stand god damn
Put your hands together, everybody got money, get the band together
Movin' like you can't stand the weather, but it ain't gon' rain always

Think I can see a fucking halo
About to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano
Some Soda for the flavor uncontrollable behavior
With some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let them take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
I'll be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve a dedication to the fandom
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner
Dawggie cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio
I been wild
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wassabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of
My clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results
Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses I lead them to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name say "crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker
Too fat to snap zippers"
And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my minds first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer
Taps slicker than past tiller
Goes around the room like his cats get finna
Oh you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony
King, you're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With those Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga give me that shit
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac
With the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?

I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
Are you made of
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish i could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived
West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
It's a dark science, when you're friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gon' by, bye then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lenghts
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remeber shit you've forgot
Cus way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived
West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing
Just wanna ask a question, have you... have you
Have you been in love before
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you
I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you
Through sunshine or rain
Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power
Swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same
Your love is not too kind to me
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
And she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one when I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you
Scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not
You up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting
Your love is not too kind to me
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
So gimme all your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

I give a fuck less and less everyday
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, N64 Blitz champion (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's Rush Hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the baby face Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Know what I'm talking about
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Feel that, go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will

You can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out
Yeah, well, climbing over that wall

Swear the height be too tall so like September I fall
Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah

Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself yeah
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, I'm treatin' me right
Hell yea, we're gonna be alright

Get the fuck out the way, must be this high to play
It must be nice up above the lights, and what a lovely life that I made

That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be good
Hell yeah, they lettin' me go
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?

We play it cool we know we fucked up, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love, so
Tell me are you really down?
Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's

Well I was riding in shotgun, speeding down the highway
Listening to music, haven't slept in like 5 days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real I swear to God this shit pretend tho'
Cause me I get high and make music for a living
If that ain't the best job then give me your opinion
Cause I love life, chilling for the night, case of budlight
Small World for me but you, you live a bugs life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier then rubbish
You softer then a snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eating beats on your thug shit
Come with all the swagger but you lacking all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school spending money, 
drinking liquor, naked girls up in my pool
Wake up in my bed gettin' head she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start, 
if you didn't make mistakes you wouldnt get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you aint shit till you try
Ay Yo my herb smoke tasting like a nerds row
'bout to get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Something like a millionaire in training
Still my shit amazing we jumpin over puddles when its raining
Planning on a tan I'm in the sand and where we jam and make it bounce
While we dancing on the clouds until I'm landing on my house
Remember when moms would hate me standing on the couch
But now I'm making so much money I start to lose count
I try to spend it quick I got bills though
Ya I'm only 18 I got skills though
Beats rhymes life tribe called chilled flow
You been rapping 25 years and you still broke
No disrespect the riches is the art
I'm just made at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this cause we love it and its setting us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark
Wake up in my bed gettin' head she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start, 
if you didn't make mistakes you wouldnt get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you aint shit till you try

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So finally I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean
It's okay that you like it babe (I like it baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (this way)
To live this way baby baby (ooh baby)
Chillin' with the ACThat's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine yeah, too divine
Who am I? Well, I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Blew your, blew your mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make you waterfall
Girl you my painting, you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Just I've been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand you so
They didn't want a man when he was down and broke
But now they know me and what I don't need
No Six, no Beamers, no Benz
That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart
These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah[Chorus]
The world is so small, till it ain't (yeah)
I'm building up a wall, till it break
She hate it when I call, and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waiting
I hope I never keep you waiting (yeah)
I think I know it all, but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you broke (yeah)
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I've never been tall (yeah)
I might trip, I never fall
God know's I've came close (no, son, this ain't home)[Verse 1]
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever
Keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five star hotel
I'm always in a rush
I've been thinking too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes
Don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)[Chorus]
The world is so small, till it ain't (till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break (till it break, till it break, till it break, till it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late (and it's late, and it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting (I hope I never keep you waiting)[Bridge]
Wooooooo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wooooooo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wooooooo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wooooooo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a bad attitude
Playing til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season (made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And a stroke is just so PGA[Pre-Chorus]
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner but I swear
It's gon be worth it if I make it, babe
There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes, we don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)[Chorus]
The world is so small, till it ain't (till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break (till it break, till it break, till it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late (and it's late, and it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting[Verse 3]
Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, and who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
(Just tell 'em Mac)Call your army, bring your tanks, I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, who the shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy you couldn't get the shoes to fit
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
Used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still with my boys I straight up grew with
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

(Verse 1)
Get some brand new kicks,
Couple hundred on the jeans,

Hand me down gear, some shit you never seen,
Droppin three stacks now, so fresh so clean,

Now my clothes look cleaner,
And my kicks look fly,

Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin

When the f-ck will I wake up,
I Ask em when the f-ck will I wake up,
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So I? ma keep on dreamin hit snooze.(Mac Miller Verse 2)
Hit snooze I aint tryna wake up yet,
Ima keep on dreamin be the straight up best,
And i? m blessed
Everyday and I? m getting straight up fresh,

And my kicks look fly,
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin

I Ask em when the fuck will I wake up,
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Um
Yeah
Well
You could have the world in the palm of your hand
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em red light, stop it
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot o' dreaming
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall, the grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been counting money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (it gets so exhausting).
Often with the bullshit, but, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah
Ok, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hand 
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know been out 
(And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town 
(But now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da, da da
So it goes (so it goes)
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da da, da da
So it goes
Well, this is a special delivery
Coming to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven
I'm still getting high
Never mind, did I mention I'm
Fine, 'cause her pussy getting
Redder when the weather dry
Clementine, peeling off
And everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'', except I'm feeling
Like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happening, my man
No relaxing, kicking back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They saying I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em fuck you, but that come on too strong
My god, it go on and on
Just like a circle, like a background prom
Well, everybody gather around
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know been out 
(And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town 
(But now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da, da da
So it goes (so it goes)
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da da, da da
So it goes

Uh. Uh. Yeah light up til the pain gone
All I hear is the same song
When the radio came on
Fuck around and get based on
Do this shit till the day I die
Are you ready, are you ready?
Terrified but my hand is steady
Verified, get the camera ready
Carry my own weight
All these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep
Diving into this cold lake
Fuck a bitch til her toes shake
Tellin' me I'm her soul-mate
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks
Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race, when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of its fun, spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews, put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logical, gettin' high, jump off the moon
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible, when the mind is so closed
Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes

Turn you into a junkie
Still searching for something, but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet, same shit we did last week
Before all the cash, you might stood up and would've walked passed me
Wake me up from this bad dream
Put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different
Got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up, I can't feel myself
Work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio, But all my problems thats real as hell
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like splinter cell
Gettin' high, blew my mind away
Find the words to what I'm tryin' to say
I'ma think of that later

Do you feel like you're alone, Will?
You have a soulmate?
Somebody who challenges you.
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you - touches your soul.
You can't give back to them, you know.
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road.
You can do anything you want, you are bound by love
Yeah, are you my soulmate, my angel?
What do you want with me?
I'm too high, slow pace, my eyes closed
Your body all I see
I think you're too, too fine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do with me to fly?
No matter what, one day everyone dies
You think you are God 'til you run out of time
Yeah, when you're gone, what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?You were the one to show me divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely, my divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go?
What's so wrong?
I'm right here
Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know I'm in pain?
I get you close, you misconstrue
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you're made of
We ain't (nothing)
Cut the strings, might belong, watch me fly
Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes,
I'm under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high
You the one to show me divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely, my divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go?
What's so wrong?
I'm right here

Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
Cause I'm smoking , till I'm coughin' up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars, shit
They got a app for... that
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me -- I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talkin' bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let them go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wilding out and being extra dope
And if God was a human it'd be yours truly
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same
I'm looking my window ashing on the pane
Shit, wonder if I lost my way
Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin'
Dreamin' of places my own personal creations
If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracin' my steps way back to biblical times
We-We all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second
I know you stressin', you don't gotta keep me guessin'
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silent treatment
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me
Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while, babe
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
(The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you)
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
(I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?)
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
((The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you)
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
(I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?)
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Will you
Will you
Will you

[Intro:]
Uhhhahhh
Top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick[Verse: Mac Miller]
Uh, I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word the double E Cummings
People say to me that it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumble bees buzzin' cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are people that which I dedicate this rap today
If I have to, I'm a crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably soundin' like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport I hop on a flight there
Wana go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like 'Yeah'
Wassup, here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm in peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number 1 albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'm a do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Cleco, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A like I'm Chris Paul
Bout to go platinum off of missed calls
So all of y'all can lick balls
Yeuhhh
Just you know[Hook:]
Run from the dark
Into the light
You know, you know you're gona find your way out
Run from the dark
Into the light
Oh-woah, you know you're gona find your way
That's right, into the sunlight [x4]

Might as wellduce
This is madness!
This is an outrage
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous
Yeah, young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious, baby go on
Take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus
Batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world kid, just do what you like"
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gonna get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad about? Go ahead and rap now
Do what you do best, I mean
That's what you do best, matter fact motherfucker
You suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a Suplex, the sun east, the moon west
You got a clue, what does a clue get?
Nothing
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still,
How Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother
Real, her face was care-worn
I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginning of Year One
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell "Hear, hear", finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we livin' how we supposed to

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free[Hook]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?So what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (x2)[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
What do you do when you think you could be an icon?
Because all these people get to screamin' with the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
Now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows, down, down
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump", a fucking hit but I call it love
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' for me on the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine[Hook]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?So what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (x2)

Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive, all we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac Miller, I love you
All of my homies used to get on my case like "when you gonna kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god... damn...And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it
Watch as time go, time moves, time flows. How do we handle these things? I am time, we are time and we have control. One thing we need to remember is that we are all in this together
You can expect the unexpected
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but...
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even though I know they need my at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it
One day we will, we will find, we will conquer, conquer with love, while time is on our side. Continue to hold to those beautiful memories. They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on, Lil B

When I was just a kid, dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause In my life time...
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (bullshittin')Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
In my life time, my whole M.O. was to get this M.O.N.E.Y
I sabotage the wealthy and the rich and the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"
I say "I know", roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash, Sounwave on the beat (wizzo)
Our Anarchy is our NR key
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia
Soul!When I was just a kid, dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause In my life time...
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (bullshittin')Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Yeah, I've seen some shit
How'd I end up in a place like this?
Swear to god, seen some shit
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
In this life time, be the time of your life
It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on
And eatin' swordfish, from gigantic portions
Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for
I don't know why what I get soo high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...When I was just a kid, dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause In my life time...
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Yeah, I've seen some shit
How'd I end up in a place like this?
Swear to god, seen some shit
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians
Good and evil people
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Lately I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all!
Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh
(Watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!)

Hey, hey,
I bet it must be nice chilling every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm working all the time, never getting me a break
Fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything will be okay
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
But everything will be all right!
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

HEY!

Well, take your vitamins!Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me come through we should smoke
Bring a pair of los, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her, she told me, "hurry come right in"
Leave your shoes up by the front, cause we just put new carpets in
She asked me bout my day then sat me down
Told me we should have some fun, there ain't nobody around
She got this crazy pill the other day while she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, just relax, she said rubbing on my back
Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it
I'mma take a trip and I'mma love it
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me I was fuckin' free
It took me, to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
Well, I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just ran right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, well it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take
If this kill me, I'mma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just some magic said I seen
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain, it something like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me I was fuckin' free
It took me, to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
I'm somebody now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me and they'll all like me. It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow alright

Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters they bring my way

While these groupie hoes try to hunt me down

Send my mind on it's way, I'm gone
Somewhere in my own dimension
I show these hoes no affection,
Just party every night gettin so demented
At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seeing to reflection
Got me wondering why don't they get it
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way
The weed is twistin' you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin'
Gettin paid but my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause it was written on a page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up

You came to prepare for the future

Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of something to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me
Baby you could be my... (woo!)
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay
Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flying high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies laying on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for being fine as hell
I'm spinning here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
I missed a day, I stay up late admiring your posture
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me
Baby you could be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And baby you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my...There's no more you or me, me or we, sweetheart
Just be your sweet babe
And I can see, I can see, so much better
I can see
I'm carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever
Oh, loving me, in spite of me
Bless your heart, bless your heart
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever
You can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay

Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes,
Shinin' like my high beams cooler than some ice tea,
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email,
Professional with shop and you would think she worked at retail,
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute, and that girl know how to blow
Somethin' like she played the flute,
That long hair and it's fallin' down her back,
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it,
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch,
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can't have this,
She smiled big, kissin' on my cheek,
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

So, my homies sayin' that's what's up,
And I hear her name's pretty from different continent
Tellin' me she's single but to tell the truth I'm not convinced,
It's all good I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit,
Thinkin' that they players but I'm coach call me Popovich,
Baby I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night,
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right,
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight,
And we ain't seen her since so tell me what does that look like,
I'm the type to bring you right back down to earth,
And for what it's worth I'll put that Louis on your purse,
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I'm guessin' she a keeper,
I think she stole it though I keep tryin' to reach her
Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back,

If you got somethin' to match,Baby you could wear my hat, 
Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back,

Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither
I been thinking about the places that are frequent
All the people that I see
I started livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She and God [?] make water wine, pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell and asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them dollars and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is
But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend
Mondays I think of you

Went up right now I ain't really tryna wait
Got me on trial but I'm beating that case
Motherfucker say it to my face
Say it to my face, motherfucker go and say it to my face
Trippin' now, everything straight
Rappers all wanna drop it now and they can't even get a date
Feeling greater than a meth head

In the middle of the ocean, see the land here
Any helicopter, fucker, we gon' land here

Don't mean to be rude, but me and you, we are not one in the same
I'm eating your food and fucking your bitch cause you is a lame
Pittsburgh, hipster, little kid damn my life changed
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
See, I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)Yeah I made a couple million off rap like it's nothing
Keep the shit quiet, I don't stunt too much
She could fuck me, she don't give it up too much
Drink liquor like water, getting drunk too much, haan
I was off them drugs too much, in the crib fucking all these little sluts too much
How it is when you young, blowing up too much
Talking shit, but I know you ain't been up to much
Man I been working, said I'm the greatest
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest
Drunk and I'm swerving, I'm going ape shit on all of my verses
Fuck being famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearing too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killing shit, bury it all in my basement
Shut your motherfucking mouth bitch
Fuck your motherfucking couch bitch
Yeah you talking, you ain't 'bout shit
Swear you a lame
I'ma keep killing shit, let them all hate
Bitches all over my basement, yeah I'm collecting
I need that money today

Yeah
Well
I got a bone to pick like roses (roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Bought a fist that got spent, I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck I'm supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride, feel the breeze
With something bad beside next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now
when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked on break, that's a motif
(That's a motif)
Yeah, when it's coming right back,
So familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about,
Runnin' through the many thought that count
Still ain't adding up, let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah
I put some money on forever, but I (hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I, just, watch, well
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep getting wider
I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey
These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listening close as I can, growing up (123) jump
Nobody holding my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never know how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (please help me)
Who can the serve the universe with me
Lucifer is human and so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks
Now, I look around like what the fuck?
If you don't fuck with me, you fucking up
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather
But I, just, watch, well, look
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep getting wider,
I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Hey, well
These are my wings
These are my wings
These are my wings

Take me to euphoria according to the story of a warrior
Picturing my visions as you look inside my cornea
I've been waiting so long
To get into her view by my side (to tell you I love you)
I can't do no wrong when you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria
And when you look in my eyes the pain goes a-way, euphoria (euphoria)
You feel so damn good, (I want you to know that)
Just come take my hand closer
We could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land
We're here now
Euphoria
Euphoria
Oh oh oh oh
Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes a-way, euphoria(Euphoria)And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can stay (like euphoria)

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from Out
Kast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out

'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I will not fall, I will stand tall

Do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady you a base-head!"
Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
Come here, slut!
"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!Hi!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me
"Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it
"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"Hi!

Stop the tape!
This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had
Hi!
My name is

Nah man, not quite finished yet...Girl I think
you just mighta just try-ta pull a muhfuckin fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my god damn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, trying to play games, see the saw blade
See the silhouette, of a stalker in your walk way, better cooperate
Or get sautéed, and rotisserie, while you're hog tied
MCs get so quiet, you can hear em all fucking dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin on that ass like the fuckin fall guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwi
Cuz it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women & men
Vrrrrrn vrrrn! motor so big you can fit a midget in its engine
Bitch gimme them digits while your cringin'
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spen-spend even ten cents on you
Since when do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit if I think a penny's pretty
Just image how beautiful, a quarter is to me
Ee-nee-mee-nee-my-nee-moe, catch an eskimo by his toe
While he's tryin to roll a snowball but, don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go ya'll(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
Get up baby get a move on, like a u-haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil, I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin chicken 'fore it hatches
Cuz, you can bet your ass that, we gonna get it crackin
Like the Kraken & Titans, when they clash and
Get your brains bashin so bad
You gonna have Kurt Cobain asking to autograph on a blood stained napkin
Unfashionable, about as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for the shit, gif my dick, Google it till it pops up
Ya'll are so motherfuckin full of shit that your stocked up
Me, I'm always shittin diarrhea at the mouth
Till your speakers crap out (pthhhhp)Ha, what? Girl you got a hot butt, like a lit cigarette (Chit- chigarette)
But you won't get a hot fudge Sunday from me
So do not strut my way slut, because...
(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
Ima show you why I came, so you stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut-cunt-whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers
Cuz I'm a fuckin' (problem), run boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word, hat you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like a killed Kenny, gas in the tank? Yeah still plenty
No morals, are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out Hannibal, Understandable why you're jealous
Fuckin' animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist 'em now can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand ya flow Understand my flow?Bitch I flow, like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy
Don't you dare try to follow or compare boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass
In ya trunk elephant (Hemorrhoids)
And remember boys...
(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
Thank you for coming out. Hope you enjoyed the show.
Until next time... peace.

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Yeah)
Too late
(I can't keep chasing em
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase
25 to life
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's
Too late for the other side
(Yeah)
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh
Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
It's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase
25 to life

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase

(feat. Eye-Kyu
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Struggling thugs, smuggling drugs
Juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling max gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it5
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience8'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Til the mornin' light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist8
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think we live in an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spreadthe terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus4
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act4
I represent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it4
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk: I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it
Eminem is headed skyward15, for those who thought
That I would make you bored6and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony5
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how wack you was9
I meant it as a diss, cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical5
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow6
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting rhythm romantically
Freaking vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAPAnd get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show, to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own

Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
Yeah, can't stop now
This may be the last chance I get
To be famous!You dream of trading places
Oh-oh, I have been changing faces
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh-oh-oh, wake up behind these trenches
Oh-oh, you run around defenceless
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But
Be careful what you wish for!I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berzerker than a fed up post office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around
When his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous!You dream of trading places
Oh-oh, I have been changing faces
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh-oh-oh, wake up behind these trenches
Oh-oh, you run around defenceless
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But
Be careful of what you wish for!I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner
Like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, you're Mini Me's
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs; you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it; you were dissing in his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E.
He's almost famous!You dream of trading places
Oh-oh, I have been changing faces
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh-oh-oh, wake up behind these trenches
Oh-oh, you run around defenceless
Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But
Be careful of what you wish for!Now there he goes in Dre's studio cupping his balls
Screaming the wood off the paneling
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "Aah!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who could've known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
There's a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it
He made it
He's finally famous!

I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?

(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and raps sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink Gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash Whiskey and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past 6 years
Mash with me again and imagine this(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)

Fuck my cousin in his asshole
slit my mother's throat
Hehe, guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sisters birthday
she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boy's
take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Her mother wasn't raped;
I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy drunk throwing up in a urinal
(YOU FUCKING HOMO!)
That's what I said up at my dad's funeral(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)

That's why we don't call it "Detroit"
We call it "Amityville"
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
That's why they're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit
This is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys;
we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come
we fuckin' shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here
that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?
While I'm holdin' a pistol
With this many calibers here?
Try some registration,
It just made the shit valid this year?'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets
Come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you when they found
You and your family in it
God damnit, admit it when he told you(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)

-RZA intro from "Airwaves"-
(King Tech)
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!(RZA)
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70, 000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his tru
A FANCY A SHAG WEE BURNERS(Tech N9NE)
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled"(Eminem)
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject(Xzibit)
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon(Pharoahe Monch)
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution*DJ Revolution scratches*(Kool G Rap)
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate(Jayo Felony)
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!(Chino XL)
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like Jon
Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in(KRS-One)
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!
FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- listen!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox
One day for every pill
Or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium
That'll hurt everything
But death is turning so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean
Didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater
Submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say
My liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death
Skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci
Same nurse, just heard say
They're unplugging me
And it's your birthday
Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry
I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting
To open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist
But I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out
I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me
I scream, but it's not allowed
You put your arm around mama
The karma, wow
I just thought about the aisle
I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you
Graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008
How's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And prove, I'm truly sorry
If I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new
For me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you
You were the glue that binded
So many things, time
I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls
And constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls
And I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain
Of you on the table
Me falling across your body
Not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive
But I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave
Take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures
Always cherish each other
I'll always love ya
And I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl
'Cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood
I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something
Thank my father too
I actually learnt a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart
Honest and open talk to you
Doody, I see you
I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body
And float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed
Pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head
Shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see those cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck
So forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched
Emotional wrecks
With every second
Each closer to death
But suddenly, I feel my heart
Begin to beat slow, then a breath
Machines go (beep, beep, beep)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape
Make a beeline
Try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find
My inner strength
To remind me
Even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake
I'm rewinding the tape(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methodome in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch
Outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to
Victory laps
Gas toward them and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
That's the song I'd have sang to my daughters
If I'd have made it to the hospital
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawning
I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning
Now I know

Yes, man!As the world turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations, that we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source, yo
They never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
"Oh my God, it's you! Not again!"
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head"
"He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
"Who? Me?"
Yeah, bitch, you so big, you walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
As the world turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through, day by day
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suing the courts'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up? It's nice to meet ya"
"I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza"
"But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month"
"But if you would care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt"
"But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers"
"Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist"
"So give me all your money and don't try nothing funny"
"'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me
With an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank God I was smokin' crack all day and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her
But yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room that's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now, she said "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come here big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh!
Go-go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, let's see who gets the best"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
"Come here, bitch!"
"Come here! Take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch!"
"Come here!"And as we go along, throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere, every day
Every single day the world keeps turning
Keeps turning
Keeps turning
Keeps turning

Yes, man!As the world turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations, that we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience

I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out
Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, asshole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it
But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the counter
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock
Just to go out watch Batman
Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bathsalts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin we have some magnetic pull
Screamin ICP in this bitch, how do magnets work!?
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical
Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical
You crackin a joke, it's laughable, cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded.
Thinkin you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor
Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my ass
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it further
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
And it ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too. You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows.

I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid

Nah I ain't Dr. Dre nah I ain't Eminem or 50

From the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum being broke
F-ck with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem

Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hoping my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R's say I ain't grind bitch
Spending my last dime on this studio time sh-t
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for tryin' this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort
I'm patiently waiting used to get love

Partner don't get it separated or twisted you cant fade it

the time your gonna find your on a great trip
(?) we on some extraordinary sh-t
the piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo son of a b-tch

One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one "ouch"
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory
storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat cos' I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
Cos when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive"
"Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, whoosh
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt?
This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M&M
Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Oh, God, police! Ahh!
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult
That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers left off

[Intro]
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ah ha, ride[Dre]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at 1
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'mma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood run cold
It's time to reload this old 45 Colt
And the wind gust, it's hot and muggy, dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
I sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I could hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head and this is what he said[Eminem]
You never met me and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim
You want revenge? Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head, too
Cuz when you[Chorus]
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cuz the bad guys always die[Dre]
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said[Eminem]
You need bullets, hurry up run[Dre]
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned[Eminem]
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want[Dre]
I figured he was telling the truth
That's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do? It's on you[Eminem]
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?[Dre]
The Chronic[Eminem]
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who?)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plagues and he already sold two[Dre]
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun[Eminem]
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us[Dre]
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming[Eminem]
He ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs and spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps[Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang in a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's eighteen hundred, he proves a AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way[Eminem]
That's when I seen Dre in trouble, then came the brigades
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plagues and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled[Chorus][Chorus]Always die
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ah ha, ride
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cuz the bad guys always die[Dre]
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said[Eminem]
You need bullets, hurry up run[Dre]
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned[Eminem]
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want[Dre]
I figured he was telling the truth
That's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do? It's on you[Eminem]
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?[Dre]
The Chronic[Eminem]
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who?)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plagues and he already sold two[Dre]
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun[Eminem]
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us[Dre]
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming[Eminem]
He ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs and spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps[Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang in a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing

[Intro]
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ah ha, ride[Dre]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at 1
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'mma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood run cold
It's time to reload this old 45 Colt
And the wind gust, it's hot and muggy, dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
I sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I could hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head and this is what he said[Eminem]
You never met me and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim
You want revenge? Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head, too
Cuz when you[Chorus]
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cuz the bad guys always die[Dre]
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain

Ah ha, ride

We never saw from each other's sides
Or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news
Love taps when I diss you
Like it was fun
Actually used to run
Back to the booth
Jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue
Lashing than you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb
Stoning was fun, back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once
And that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?Girls your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because
How come you can be a lord of illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod
When my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks
In that tiny box
When we tied the knot
When we broke the knot
Every line we crossed
We were supposed to not
Every time we fought
Being souls that got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we could've read
Which maybe would've lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself
How come you can be a lord of illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
In my eyes
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that was what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now
And all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard Mockingbird
And got the urge to jot me some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've got a few
And so have you
Or argue who's fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine
But really no ones
This is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts
Backstab each other
Another blow struck
But there's no ducking this blow
Cause it's over
And it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people could be
so good at one thing and so fucked at another
It's no wonder
How come you can be a lord of illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}

(Eminem)Hand me an, 8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {Ahh!}
Human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not {yup}
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?

{Just do it!}(Eminem)I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!
(Three){Just let it gooo!}

(Eminem)My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little "home away from home"
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said
Who hard? Yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation collaborating attempting to take over the Earth'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
He's insane
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt
Hello?
Ayo, what's up?
We're coming to get you!Stop! They know it's us!I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three 'shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to Hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
We'll be waiting
See you in Hell
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel
Bad Meets Evil, what
Till next time
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...
Wait, did y'all hear that?

Shhh...
Wait, did y'all hear that?

Oh! It's music to my ears.
Oh, man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin' great man!
Ok, let me see, how can I begin?Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread wine, more bread wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch
Mariah whatever happened to us
Why did we have to break up, all I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much, I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin' I want her back ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want
I mean I really want ya bad ya cunt
Nick you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
You can be a permanent fixture, in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster my signature
Sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant wow
Man, what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fucking annoyin' drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck you're doing
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon ya prick I wish ya luck with the fuckin' whore, every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're running over the snow blower with the lawn mower
Blow on your bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said, to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends? You need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other especially when your joined at the hip
I'm going to get a needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch them back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid flick
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag of bagpipes from Baghdad
Huhulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa

Oh! It's music to my ears.
Oh, man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin' great man!
Ok, let me see, how can I begin?Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread wine, more bread wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch
Mariah whatever happened to us
Why did we have to break up, all I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much, I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin' I want her back ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want
I mean I really want ya bad ya cunt
Nick you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
You can be a permanent fixture, in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster my signature
Sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant wow
Man, what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fucking annoyin' drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck you're doing
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon ya prick I wish ya luck with the fuckin' whore, every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're running over the snow blower with the lawn mower
Blow on your bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said, to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends? You need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other especially when your joined at the hip

Huhulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa
Huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you?I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap ineed a new outlet
I know some shit's so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room just as soon
As I walk in it's like all eyes on me so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of them ain't even funny like
"Ah! Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in at every single place every school i went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find

To my babies
Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you the shoes that fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
And be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful

Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake
And let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale
Can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor
The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast
The more asserted, never looking back
May hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve
As you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to, to avert a disaster
Lucky, no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
So familiarize
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart
And steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
Because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means
You will survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you
From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good
That you're willing
To forgive them even after
All that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in
But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof
You're just chillin' and you look down
'Cause you're so over them you could
Put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds? Wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's gone down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising
A phoenix from the flames
Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
Now it feels with these wings that I will fly
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light:

And I, started from the, bottom
Like a, snowman, ground up
Like round chuck, still put hands on you
Staying wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got the air about me
Like wind chimes (yeah)
Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community is gated
And I made it, and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
I'm giving them pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days of, minimal wage for
General labor, welfare recipients is a minor
Look at how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first if you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke is a poor excuse
That shit only gives you more fuel
Show them why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in timebombs and horseshoes
So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)
No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?
Do you still believe
In me?Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
(I never quit) Do you still believe?
In me?Man I know sometimes these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, there's just ink blots
I just fling them like slingshots, and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger is free as a bird
New warhead-ed birth, you just forehead-ed on earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consoling you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel so people are
always looking at me as they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear, shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleaning Out My Closet" when
I was having trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up,
like you're trying to fix a flat (uh), when you struggle with a spare
That double fisted bear,
knuckles coupled with this pair of nuts I'm cupping
I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare
Do you still believe
In me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
(I never quit) Do you still believe?
In me?Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof on my back
I called you a groupie 'cause I knew for a fact
My insulin ho
Homie I'm calling on you 'cause I think
I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that quick mota.Motivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans with the two-faced that show
Let heartbeats loot, produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose chains
'Cause all my dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too
So what the fuck are you gonna do, use the tools you're given?
Or are you going to use the cards you were
dealt as an excuse for you to not do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
Until I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was still on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I ran in place while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace and
the hunger pangs once you've won the race
When that pool of exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit them with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with that Bruce Willis
That blue steel, that truth still
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em "stick it"
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, yah, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch!
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch!(Take your shoes off)

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep
And woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
Car note!
Oh!Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man

(Let your hair down and)

All night long(Grow your beard out)
(Just weird out and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn your volume loud, cause its gonna mayhem till the AM
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go Berzerk), shake your body
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang - bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang dang
P-p-p pow pow chicka chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel toww

So turn your volume loud, cause its gonna mayhem till the AM
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, get your vials
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep
And woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
Car note!
Oh!Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard! But don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam(Take your shoes off)

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em "stick it"
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, yah, shout out to Kendrick

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind; this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now, I need you to open your mind; your eyes, close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now, why did they make Yoo-hoo?
Hippity ga-ga boo-boo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?I've been dying to ask; it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was; I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot; no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay?
You're droolin', you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck d'you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks; wanna chew some gum?
"Yes I do, sir; what am I on?"
You, sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you"
"Please say you won't tell nobody""I'd be so embarrassed; I'm just absolutely terrified"
"That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying"
"All these terrible, evil, and awful mean things"
"It's my own insecurity"You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, now, we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like; want to check to see?
Here's a mirror; notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on
Now look in this mirror; how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you; I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why're you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this:
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the is, you're just a...You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Get the fuck off my dick

I don't understand

Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to sat goodbye to me
Can't promise you a million bucks
But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
Day one we'd go fishing
Dollar movies on day two
Days three and four we'd spend in bed
Just like we used to
A million days with you
Would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways for our friendship to last
I've got a million ways
Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to say goodbye to me
Day five we would ride our bikes
Camping on day six
Days seven and eight I'd show you how much I love you
A million days with you
Would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways for our friendship to last
I've got a million ways
Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to sat goodbye to me
Can't promise you a million bucks
But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
A billion days with you
A billion days with you

Justin? It's Zoe
Uhm, Kellie did not have me call you
However I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously want to call his fucking agent and tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It like makes me upset, I am now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
Goodbye

Yeah, what up Detroit
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again
Wha-wha-wha-what?
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that, this is special right here
Wha-wha-wha-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Aww yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre
Just let me lay back and kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but ISomehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done
Get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up 'cause
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Aww naww, big Slim Dogg, eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby, he's Shady
He's so crazy
Gimme the mic, let me recite 'till Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right, I'm just a criminal
Making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the "fag" word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
"Suck my fucking dick, you faggot", you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance2001 and forever
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on!
Yeah

Yeah, what up Detroit
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again
Wha-wha-wha-what?
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that, this is special right here
Wha-wha-wha-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Aww yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre
Just let me lay back and kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but ISomehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done
Get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up 'cause
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Aww naww, big Slim Dogg, eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby, he's Shady
He's so crazy
Gimme the mic, let me recite 'till Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right, I'm just a criminal
Making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the "fag" word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
"Suck my fucking dick, you faggot", you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance2001 and forever

He's convulsing!
Ah!
He's convulsing!
Oh my!
We're gonna have to shock him!Oh my God!
We're gonna have to shock him!Oh my God!These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
"Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse!"
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you'll die"
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!"
He said "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"I screamed "Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!""Teacher, teacher, quick! I need a naked nurse!""What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts!""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy!""Oh! I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over""And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework""But don't you wanna give me after school detention?""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him"Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him "We shouldn't beef"
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said "You gonna die honkey!"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
"This is for every time you took my orange juice"
"Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk"
"Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt"
"I'm gettin' you back bully!"
"Now once and for good"
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin'
"What are you on, drugs?"
"Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed "Look bitch, what have you done!?"
"Oh my God! I'm sorry son!"
"Shut up you cunt!"
I said "Fuck it!"
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Who can say for sure?

If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourette's
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbours hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimming scisors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch's, predicaments, despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of liquorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his toosh, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head
Mama always said
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness(Mama always said)"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"

Fast forward some years later: a teenager
This is a fun, sweet! I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stomped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance to make it or succeed 'cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school, this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be dahmer
'Cause mama always said"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"

Now my mom goes "womp, womp, womp"
'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out "Go!"
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
They were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out, whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, till then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' - insert insult here -
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
This Hip-Hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got that white trash traffic and gridlock
Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
'Cause I turn into the unabomber

It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school, this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be dahmer
'Cause mama always said"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness(Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
Now my mom goes "womp, womp, womp"
'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out "Go!"
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
They were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out, whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, till then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' - insert insult here -
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
This Hip-Hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got that white trash traffic and gridlock
Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
'Cause I turn into the unabomber
Mama always said
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
(Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't

It Fits Perfect
Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin and I'm packin in my lunch a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, "Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked will you let me watch ya?
Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks,
"Mista, help me"'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks,
In clumps - the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways-
Carcasses of caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place?
Hide em in the wall- well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin,
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within.
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin,
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win.
Severin legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin, so chill. Fuckin hoe, ya better fuckin hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut em, gut em 'n just get to stuffin those girls.
Man, I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel
Blades, Baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!
I keep hearin voices, like "Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?"
"In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin with? Duck, because here he comes again.Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up
And I don't see either one of us budging
I'm with holding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else, to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cause it annoys him to see, that I ain't scared
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully)I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully)Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally (bully)
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef, with this faggot Ja' But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man, to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dawg you just did a song, with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up, as a white bitch
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully)I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully)Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully)You must be taking to much (bully)
Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Puck
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Toungue, and Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Anyworse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halie's name
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully)
I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully)
Irvine get your boyed off that (bully)
Get at me, dawg
Holla

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on fire
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
But don't compare me
I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin wreckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled

(Missy) Slim Shady (4X)(Eminem)
Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
and punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches
Hit a fuckin (*pregnant chick*) in her (*stomach*) with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy . Slim Shady

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
to give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)
and waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy . Slim Shady

Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building

Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire(Missy)
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back

Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire(Missy)
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind!
I think somebody done pissed her off this time!
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
uhh, you will have to clean up the mess (uh-huh)
It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (uh-huh)
Lay em on down, like they lived underground (uh)
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now
Uhh. one-two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh
Cool, cool, cool
Triple zero

Marshall! Sounds like an S.O.S!
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics André, you're fucking right!
To the rap-mobile, let's go!Marshall!Marshall!Bitches and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show, his name is
Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you
Marshall!You 'bout to witness hip hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Back!
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off their hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine-one-one, so
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness?
(Hell Yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness?
(Hell Yeah!)Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks, who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and André's carnival, c'mon!Now let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness?
(Hell Yeah!)It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career russian roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Till we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around round here
Yo Dre!
(What up?)
Can I get a hell yeah?(Hell Yeah!)Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down

Oh! Hah!

OHH! Stat Quo! Here we go!
C'mon, c'mon! You ready? (heh)
Let's do it man (uh uh uh uh-uhh)
Shady Aftermath
Sound, without focus, is just noise+ (Eminem)
Yeah (where you get that thang man) {By my side}
When you do somethin to somebody umm {By my side}
It ain't just you it's somebody next to you {By my side}
Youknow'mtalkinbout and I got my shit right here with me {By my side}
(There isn't everywhere you go that it's) {By my side}
(Okay) So being that that's the case {By my side}
Let me tell you about {By my side}
That place, heh, take you by my side {By my side}The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
But came ahold of choppin them boulders gettin older
Wantin a Rover, ducked in them rows meetin quotas
Shorty bipolar, load her by cock I tried to told ya
When movin the wrong direction ain't no flesh and then it's over
You on that doja, G.I. Joe shit but you ain't a soldier
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
I'm the composer, writer of murder, the odor
Leakin out of your body, temperature is gettin colder
But you sweatin and dizzy like a person who ain't sober
Realizin your life is comin quickly to a closure
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game, and it's the fourth quarter
Primetime, "Dateline" are the best exposure
Now you're still, on the news and everybody knows ya
Yeahhhh, YEA!By, my, side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's - by my side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's - by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)Go now boy, get your vest, protect yo' neck, kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter when I go and pull out my gun (gun)
Call me ignorant and young, psycho sicko negro
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
Drivin crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come, believe every word out my lungs
I'm losin it, snappin huh, this ain't just no rappin uh
Back all the way back when you see that strap cause it go ra-tata-ta
Are you ready to die tell me why you choose to tell me in my
Face, have your body dry, pack that fire, look in my eye
Have your spirit below me or floatin in the fuckin sky
All black is my attire, lookin like a umpire
Toss you in the trash like a bullshit album flop
Yeah yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh, YEA!The murder capital mo' mayhem, yes it's thriller
Put four in your head, have you floatin off in a river
It's cold, you shook, we crooks, your body'll quiver
These rappers so tough but really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla or Twinkie filler, hone of a realer
They turn to serial assassins for some scrilla
Now me could see I mean him, yes this nigga
Stays true to what I do cause I keeps it realer
Be for real, have you ever ever pulled a trigger?
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeahhhh, YEA!By my side, by my side
It's "The Re-Up"

Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store with a Treacherous Four cassette
and a cassette recorder
in Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman from the Hessian war and hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers, and deadbolts on the bedroom door, and sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend!Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'till there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn, and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores, and sore shins, pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course on excessive force and pressure points,
and dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bullseye on his back
His whole chest, and torso are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him!In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction, there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."Expired tags on the Saturn...
Got Catherine Bach in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on at a traffic stop gettin' harassed, signed an autograph for this asshole cop's daughter
Laughed 'cause I called her a brat on it, he spat on it, and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack, and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it, and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock
One ball and half a dick: Apple Watch
Cracked front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and asked if they had a laugh in stock?
That was fuckin' stupid...You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic?
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
There's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit, but I shout derivatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launchers
Misfit, blond, and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes!" and became one...
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser,
shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for "some assaults"
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's'es
Something's aweful when Dustin Hoffman's dressin' up in your mummy costume
on stage dancin' to "Brain Damage,"
What's the problem? Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'mma dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man, but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet 'cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted, a fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button who doesn't have to answer to no one?
Great idea!If I was president "gettin' off" is the first order of business
once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand, screamin', "Fuck safe sex!"
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him!
Tell Congress I run this land, and I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon, but as fate would have it,
I walked up in Major Magics dressed as the maintenance man in a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket with a gauge to blast it, and sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches, and slam on the brakes in traffic so hard I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'finna get a murder case and catch it like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'
like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin',
and skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder, knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla, The Rap God?
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I...Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta, not give a slapstick hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off like an arm when it's lopped off of ya, but I'm not gonna get the shotgun or the Glock I'm gonna opt for the ox 'cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop, and it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker...
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter?That was for 50Little slap on the wrist, be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel!But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen and never appear again if you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them...Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes
Tush mushed against your damn side, your puss
and thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapman might just have to picket me like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling, violent, perhaps are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that, but as far as these lines I rap,
and these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track
Why am I such a dick?

"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go:Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass"
Hey mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin little vaginal blister?
Stanibus: little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it:
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me?
The fourth letter: "Slim you're really startin' to upset me"The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre:
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way"So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" "What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri
Fuck it," Keep goin', no time to waste"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case
"Okay," Fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, Only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard."Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice"What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice. Kept jabbin', Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back. I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! Till the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!
Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

Breaking News: Detroit Rapper Eminem cancels his sold out European tour to check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops...
Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be a random drive by shooting, meanwhile Eminem is rumored to be...
On-and-off-again relationship with...
This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's...
Updating a story we brought to you earlier about gunfire at an after hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot...
Shady Aftermath recording artist...
Long time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12...
D12 back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem; he insists he's just taking a break, but now its believed hes retiring, leaving us all to ask: Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up?
So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in)to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk
So be Careful What You Wish For
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be Careful What You Wish For'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least
A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit
So be Careful What You Wish For
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be Careful What You Wish For
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song
You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously, assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
Love, daddy
Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup
I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby
I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters and studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering
I'm gonna turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'm gonna do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between 'em, since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damn
I never knew it'd be like this
If I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit
Now you're being punished?
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And, if things should worsen,
take this letter I wrote as a goodbye note
Because your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
Love dad
Shit, I don't know

I just touched down, Ferrari to concrete
I ain't even home and they 're talking about me
fuck out my ear if you talking
'bout freedom nigger Free don't pay the bills Im ballin' all out, b! You rappers
don 't know me Nah I ain't your homie If your name aint Em, Ferrari or Tony
I like my wheel chromey
My Bentley my Rolly
My Magnum my forty
South Jamaica shawty
these losses I took in the gut yo
the work 's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow
Clear my mind, you whippin ' the truck load
my Pop dead, but he live through his son though
if rap aint work, I'll be pimpin' on some hoe Still eating lobster and shrimp in
the Bungalow
I'm back like crack over the drumroll
You know, wherever I go the gun go [Akon - Chorus]
We on the grind (hey) all the time (hey)
ain't bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine, you see the shine
I might just let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper, paper
While I get this paper, paper
Cause I'm a celebrity (I don 't need none of y 'all) Ghetto celebrity
(Keep your punk-ass awards)
I'm a celebrity (Take your fake smile off)
Ghetto celebrity
aint nothing changed nigger
The media will test ya, popularity is pressure
Porche Panamera
platinum hammer through the
metal
wreck the booth up, I'm too tough
that inner city grammer
step your jewels up, they bruised up
I'll sparkle for the camera harsh reality 's what (?) holding them back from openingverbal attack all over these niggas, push the herd to the back
I'm the kind that they pray on, spending half of their day on
lay on, niggas for days, just shots spray onmy sound system knock and in pound Tupac6-4 jumping like the ground too hot
they spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
two shots in the air for niggas that aint here
two tone, two door, grey top, roof floor
green guap galore, in and out of new hall
that bright light you saw, was a paparazzi flash
I'm tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass 
...there are enough insults in my head
to fill up a swear jar
and have it overflowing so dont get me going, don't dare start
you 'll never see me again, Amelia Earhart
I'm poppin' a wheelie off to a really unfair start
I'm past grinding for me, guess I just be grounded up
like ground round or a pound of chuck
tightly wound as fuck
till the fire marshalls come shut
Fire marshall ground 'em up I guess you should just shut the fuck up
and stop fucking around and duck
I aint playing this time, I told you I 'm not down for blunts to say I keep it 100
would probably sound redundant
like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck
and blowing your dick cock
is she up to scew and down to fuck
it's a man's World and I'm trapped in a land of smut
with a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles
running through a house of muts
otherwords I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth 's up and I'm watching
my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt
and aint shit changed, my shit still dont stink player
my farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity
maybe my complexion became a little paler
poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor yeah, see me up all in
your bitch means I 'ma rape her, all I got for these hoes is dick duck tape and a
stapler so bitch you better look for table
scraps to scrape her
I don't subscribe to the news or the free press but homie I get the paper!

Instinctive nature,
to bring the anguish (yeah) to the English language
With this ink, you haters get wrote on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place
to place, you barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell's rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Why your bound notebook got tied around your throat
it inside your mouth, go "HRUHHH"That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your fleshful dead
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Sketchers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher
Electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch...I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Yeah, uh
And still conjoined at the hip with hop
Still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
And it's filled and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buldin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
Like what? Like a real thin joint, it
What? Comes on Quilted Northern
And what? In a built-in toilet
Yeah, bitch I told you I'm a dog (woof, woof)I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah)
Million voices in my head, but still get a little bit of thrill
And some real enjoyment
Off what? Off the feel of going in
Like? Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a M.I.L.F. when blowin' me'Cause like Kandor and two, rippin' the condom in two, woo!
Dick is a bargain or two, now I'm gettin' blue like Kolonopins
Would you? I go there, you wouldn't?
Well, I still have a few views, and comment on you
Just not You
Tube, 'cause...I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan, yeah!Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex time
I clock rejects into the next line
Talkin' reckless, that is just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my
Columbian neck tie
Prostitute just climb in the Humvee and lets ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life (sex crime)
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her
Up, binds up, cuts, slices her twice
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up, under thighs, ugh, like a gyser, uh
Music, please
Enthusi', instead of roofie
Goal is to get a floozie inside the jacuzzi
And have a loosie, goosey as coozie is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued me be, I'm tru
TV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're spoony, GNo diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like...Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you

Somethin' to chew

Yeah
(Definitely, definitely, definitely, dope, definitely, definitely K-mart)
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line on any fences
If so to what extent
If at any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other peoples' expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic'Cause I ain't got no legs!Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is...
Rain Man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip-ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)

Yeah
You know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
Yeah!
Feels good!
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowing this one
Nah, man!
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
There's a storm coming that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug, prick you better, flee cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down, I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick, it's a trap
Fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat your eyelashes, and keep winking and blowing kisses'Cause you're flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep
I catch a flow and get going, no remorse I'm showing, ain't slowing for no one
Knowing there is nothing you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva: what can you do?Go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like "Whoooo!"That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?
Now guess who?
Here's a clue
He came to a ball in his wife beater lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella man
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)Fuck catching lightning, he struck it, screamed "Shut up" at thunder and flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it - don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka, he's the shit right now he's
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say "bye" to the old, "H-I" to the new que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce
Raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient, I will make no more mistakes
Shit, my potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smoking weed, yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of God, the skin on my teeth! and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
How fucking irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm the spitting image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it, your pussy lyric: I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists, who?
Here's a clue
He came to a ball in his wife beater lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella, Cinderella man)
If I had a time machine
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
I'd be
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

Yeah
You know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
Yeah!
Feels good!

Now, what's his name?(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella man
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)Fuck catching lightning, he struck it, screamed "Shut up" at thunder and flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it - don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka, he's the shit right now he's
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say "bye" to the old, "H-I" to the new que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce
Raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient, I will make no more mistakes
Shit, my potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smoking weed, yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of God, the skin on my teeth! and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
How fucking irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm the spitting image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it, your pussy lyric: I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists, who?
Here's a clue
He came to a ball in his wife beater lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella, Cinderella man)
If I had a time machine
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
I'd be
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

[Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke there nose in our business
What is this some kinda joke
Everywhere I go all I'm hearing is more talk
What's up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doin' a song with ol' boy on the song "New York",
Man I thought you just did a song with them both?"
Man the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass you asshole
You really wanna know when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming u know
I aint grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man this is my testimony to those that don't know
Man it felt like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too.
So this d-ck goes to you and this d-ck goes to you
And if you feel like you want it you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Hey yo Stat get on the Mic and come and spit a few[Stat Quo]
Muthaf-ckers so quick to spit bullsh-t
Stat Quo who's this
Em gave me the assist shorty got a full [?]
Standing in the pulpit, A - Town misfit
Reppin dat south sh-t
Back for [?]
[...]
Losing patience wanna get on chasing for this
Taking all my energy
Tired of waiting people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they really enemies
Give a f-ck what it is cause
This what it gonna be,
Shady aftermath lately
GMN baby
Young n-gga out them projects [?]
Hospital freda's only baby
N-ggas biting my style get rabies
F-ck you pay me
Eat a cock swallow sh-t
And plus you aint f-cking with this
So don't trip ha ha [?]
What an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it's endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic sh-t

Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo
Yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me
But they never figure me out
Look at me now
I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama?
Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ah
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby
Maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split
I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't owe him a second thought
I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie
And I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim
I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her, at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid
No doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em
Shit, I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life
I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position
Just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what?
You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now
You should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her
She won't even be at your funeral
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what?
I am dead, dead to you as can be!I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going

Shit the day that happens

During a earthquake
urine in your face
cuz your fake
Aahh, what the fuck, that hurt wait
Aahh, what the fuck

God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord forgive me for what my pen do[This is for your sins, I cleanse you
and you can repent but I warn you,
if you continue, to hell I send you]And just then the wind blew
and I said...Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-How long will I be this way?
Shady, until my dying day
Until I hang up the mic
and it's time for me to say

If you don't like it

Now sing along
Slut this, slut that
learn the words to the song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women
when Aquaman drowns and
The Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo

It's like apples to oranges
Peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas
Pussy cut off the grapes
and grow a pair, but I swear
you try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything
Like everyone does
We're auto-tuned
The last thing you want to do

When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no

Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-I don't know
I don't know what caused

What caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably
be this way until my dying day
I don't know why I'm so
I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

'Cause some things just don't change, it's better when they stay the same
I'll throw the whole world knows your name, so on the biggest stage
they came to see you spit your game, oh oooh

Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-How long will I be this way?
Shady, until my dying day
Until I hang up the mic
and it's time for me to say
so long till then I drop the
fucking bombs like I missed
the pass when I went long
If you don't like it
you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along
Slut this, slut that
learn the words to the song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women
when Aquaman drowns and
The Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
so don't compare me to
them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges
Peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas
Pussy cut off the grapes
and grow a pair, but I swear
you try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything
Like everyone does
We're auto-tuned
The last thing you want to do
is have me spit out a rhyme
and say I was writing
this and I thought of you so
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-I don't know
I don't know what caused
I don't know
What caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably
be this way until my dying day
I don't know why I'm so
I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up
Hey yo what is the what?
Well come on in, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my group, bitch
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin my ass whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever get ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be brauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap Then it's a wrap, Then it's a scrap
an it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a bit, boy, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do, 50
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidently (argghhh!)
I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy, and Proof are you with me?(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on un- til the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin til 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in(Swifty)
They said of me, the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat. It's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly poppin slugs. they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses, A halocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dark shit, I'ma gothic death prophet. yo stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
You n***az need a 'E' just to speak shit
an Your leader is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it an won't even keep it a secret
N***a I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on un- til the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up, mother fuckers. Quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in(Kuniva)
Yo yo
I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
"What tha fuck" did he say in his rap Em?
I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas 'll squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, is my family a couple (?)
Am I (?)? To emtpy out them (?)
To fight you in front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
Just emotion's enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT?!"
I might as well give this up
But tha'd be selfish as fuck to leave D12 an' it's What?
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life(Kon Artis)
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fifth
Your carcas'll split even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause n***az 'll test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
Or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred n***az from (?)
So get to gunnin if you comin(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on un- til the break of dawnin'
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady!So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre
They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
Can't you see what you do to me baby?You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love what's that that's attracting us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators
And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-
-ture than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'You play your position, you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind sometimes
They say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire
You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs
To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you
As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe
How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You are like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you

Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
Can't you see what you do to me baby?You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac

A lot of people ask me
Stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that
What I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it
Or that I believe in it
Well, shit
If you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why?'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal!
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal!
Yeah, I'm a criminal!My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags?
The answer's "yes"
Homophobic?
Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em
"Hey, it's me, Versace"
"Whoops, somebody shot me!"
"And I was just checkin' the mail"
"Get it? Checkin' the male?"
How many records you're expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax Guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen
"Ayyy, men!"
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh and please send me a brand new car and a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher, preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just lil ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal!
An animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ____
My morals went "pffft" when the president got oral sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die in plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
"The maniac's in"
Replacing the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm taking his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
Criminal!(Alright, look, just go up in that motherfucker)
(Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there)
Alright
(I'll be right here waitin' on you)
Alright
(Yo, Em!)
What!?
(Don't kill nobody this time!)
Alright... goddamn, this fucker gets on my fuckin' nerves...(Hi!)
How you doin'?
(How can I help you?)
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch, and I won't kill you
(What?)
(Oh my God, don't kill me!)
I'm not gonna kill you, bitch! Quit fuckin' around...
(Don't kill me, just please don't kill me!)
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you...
(Don't kill me...)
Hurry the fuck up!
Thank you!Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it, so I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough to say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

Yo, mic check

One, two, uhm... twelve
Whattup, whattup, whattup!
This is my dance song
Can you hear me?
Alright, ay turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed from Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!Cum on everybody

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody screaming "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd and yell out loud
"All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
"But Eminem this is your record release party!"
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a mothafuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like "Gee, I don't know, he might be!"
I told 'em "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"
"I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"
"Peace out", then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out till I started bustin' freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face,
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits! Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin' Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-EThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong (Yo Big, you dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on

You're dead wrong (Yo Big, you dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wron
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong (Yo Big, you dead wrong)

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin' horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any fagot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third,
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin' horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any fagot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third,
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on

DMC, we have a mid-30's male found down, unresponsive.
Possible overdose, substance unknown.
Pulse is 60 and thready. Respiration's 8.
He's intubated, and we're baggin' him now.
Uhh, BP: 90 over palp. Patient is cool, pale, and diuretic.
Has aspirated.
Uhh, GSC is 3. We'll update en route. ETA: ten minutes.As I, fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Ny
Quil then I salivate
Start off with the Ny
Quil like "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like "Ya that's great"
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake, look at my daughter's face
"Mommy something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car reading Three Musketeers in the rear seat"Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me as
soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu, I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie
cause I don't, and why I just don't know
Maybe just a nice cold brew "What's a beer?"
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin hear
"Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out, cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?Man, fuck am I hungover and God damn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by"Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me assoon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu, I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie
cause I don't, and why I just don't know
So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if De
Shaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full blown re-lapse
"Just get high until the kids get home from school Holmes relax"
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insom-niac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Amb! en each nap, how many Valium, three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing
It was baloney was it the methadone ya, think
Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb! en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie, "I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina"
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door, and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me as
soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu, I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie
cause I don't, and why I just don't know

Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a Roethlisberger
You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops or syrups
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs to cause to learn
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I can't be apart from her
Cause nobodies body's awesomer - I lust it, and she loves me cause I'm popular, but
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation
She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It's desperation)
I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her
and here i go again
Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
Cause now you see nothin but me, and I don't see nothin but you
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin bout "I live and breathe you"
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, cause this ain't...Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think
You need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? (what) Delicia
I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover
You been using me for loot like I used you for looks
Thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack, but I can't stomach this
I'm leavin you, not comin back. She said "The fuck with that
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights

Fuck an intro man, let's go.I come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up, better not let them breathe
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
hoes I hope all you rot
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum, yall ain't nothing but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on in rap
yeah but I'm home
Bad to the bone,
Back in the zone,
Let him alone
You don't wanna go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you're oncrown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygenother words there's no heir to the throne
when I die so does hip hop
Hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got, a zip locked in a bag
you fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight,
talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging itflow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging itpull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight outta Compton shit
take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment
jackass eat a donkey dick
the game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit!
I reign supreme in this honkey shit!
no sense screaming, and arguing
makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in!
you think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy it's obvious
you can tell I go right off the batno pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos I'm as despicable, as Daffy Duck when I'm spitting,

I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor I smashed up everywhere
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here do die didn't you?
Why didn't you responded yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do, shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So Violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said "honey, I'm back"Just so you don't die alone
Just so you don't die alone
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never
comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bowled like bowling balls
No calls and know to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles I'm startin to hallucinate
And I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said "honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone
Just so you don't die alone
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still with in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it, now my head is overcrowded
With these tired memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you, huh?
Complete, madly, head over heels for you
Was you and me, wants us to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said "honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone
Just so you don't die alone

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get
for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like.Everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
without these cameras in our faces like animals
for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch
Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
a front door with twelve locks
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
and one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
so my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
"Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
just for tryin to stand on his porch"
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like "Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you.
it's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you

[50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me (and)
I need you to care for me (and)
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
Flows, bones, crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with somethin'
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinnin'
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot (gun shot), you know I ain't stoppin'
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, gun smokin', still locin'
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling[Chorus 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy[Lloyd Banks]
I cross my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry
To young to understand, the consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas
'Cause they funny 20 years, of watching my mama's tears
Got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong, cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried
balled in the dirt, from shots flurry
Layin' with bugs all under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels, gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flyin'
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin'
What I'm clutchin', to give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
And it's either soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier[Chorus X2 50 Cent]Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy[Eminem]
These are my ideas
This is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw, with my balls, my ears
This is me, who's got to be
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til they shoot em up bang
When you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'
I'm a start layin' into these motherfuckering cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as man, bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You want to see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fuckin' old farts,
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow, little soft yellow punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause[Chorus 2X]Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

Obie, Yo?I'm sick
Damn, you straight dogg?Bitches
Getting sick
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of tha skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the Cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french role styling
body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit getting bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga?
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between her hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
Me in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut - then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here? This bitch evapourated
Pussy and all just picked up and vaccated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit
Fuck
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time
Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
What's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickend 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you goto the clinic, sweating every minute your in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace hahahaha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's aids
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see her, you're gon' bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the Cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceaving, shit this ho's a genius she gee'd us
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time"I'm busy!"Yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck 'em all
Get money
Ha!Shady Records

Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you goto the clinic, sweating every minute your in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace hahahaha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's aids
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see her, you're gon' bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the Cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceaving, shit this ho's a genius she gee'd us
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time"I'm busy!"Yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck 'em all
Get money
Ha!Shady Records
Woow!Obie Trice
Eminem motha fucka
New millenium shit
Yeah
Turn this shit off
Turn this shit the fuck off

Obie, Yo?I'm sick
Damn, you straight dogg?Bitches
Getting sick
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of tha skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the Cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french role styling
body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit getting bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga?
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between her hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
Me in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut - then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here? This bitch evapourated
Pussy and all just picked up and vaccated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit
Fuck
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I aint got no time
Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
What's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickend 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick

Yeah boy, them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh my God, fucking bumbaclot, I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in the Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothin' but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal and charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy you think you're Tom Sawyer
Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on you
Fuckin' fictional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourselves for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline, bounce, and grap a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothin', no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother(Drop the bomb on 'em)
Please don't drop the bomb on me, Shady
Shady, please don't drop the bomb on me(Drop the bomb on 'em)
I don't want no dog-gone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Boy, I'm the real Mc
Coy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre, the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
That scalp cowboys, now how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off and before you have a sound voyage
Sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar of
Whip-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, boy, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin' ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot, when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop, and when it does, boy, there's a problem
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder
The grater, the beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? couldn't agree
With you more if you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in in a minute
Ayo this is my love song
It goes like this
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin'
You're beginning to think women are swimmin in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and 'cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outter space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as you
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want
Whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal chord
So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls
Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now I'm gonna try to find some more'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every morning
But your young you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I would've did more shit that people said that I shouldnt
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done before I know it
I'll be forty with a forty on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out gettin' smashed'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?Drugs really got a hold on me
Really got a hold on me
'Cause drugs really got a hold on me
They really got a hold on me

Oh, all around the World
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo
Classical palms
battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
bad as I need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
Im at it or prone
first time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
in order to clean my things you need saline
Im never refering to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang
vroom
get respect from the get-go, hello
set to the echo, pyscho
pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the Maserati
as the petrol swallows
Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep
right now I'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper Shady recordsbaby echo
Oh, all around the World
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lowsthey will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only f-cking thing that you consume is time
Im super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle
rhyming to the call, to the bunghole all the way down to my sock and the hair on my toe
ever since I was 13 I Iearnt how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
and this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light hercause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet
Ima go get TIP and try to rip it wider
Oh, all around the World
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo

All aboard, okay... Next stop, my basement... haha, I'll meet you down there
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's an honour who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking AV
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's is in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason slash leatherface n'
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner snitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass doctor dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one breif second
And you pussy queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Thinkin' about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin-A even got a biday
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

Aftermath, ha ha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, ha ha
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the Doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Times up, game's over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time50 Cent, come on!Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honeys involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day it's just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So nervous, ain't never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
Yeah, ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, ha ha50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Oh!
Last one baby, let's go
Detroit!

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Oh!
Last one baby, let's go
Detroit!

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me

Oh!
Last one baby, let's go
Detroit!

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think
I think the lines are starting to get blurred
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped for battles sucka
Duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping till the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut"
"But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall"
(Palin!)
Oh, my bad... Slut
And next time I show to in court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?"
"Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you"
"And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker"
"You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you au jus"
"Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
(Rape your mother, kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots, they run
around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck" adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits
Fuck that, I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From thr first album even the gals were like "Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines
Where I'm at
And the way I feel now, feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
There's darkness closing in, there it goes again
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So who's left, Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch!
Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met De
Shaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear
Like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin, so who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh! LMFAO
Oh, no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the like Casey Anthony, hey ho
Hey-ho!
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray", no
I'm hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think
I think the lines are starting to get blurred
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints

Ew ew ew ew

You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my-Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You want it, Shady? You got it!Don't fall on my fate
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body baggage zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "he ain't spit like this in his last shit"
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up"
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever
Don't fall on my fate
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy
Just remember-I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Brush my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire

Uh, first verse, uh, I'm on till I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Slap up a cop and then snatch 'im out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hangin' by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' Ice Ice Baby
Screamin' Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll
(Damn)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Try them trailer parks, crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital "B" with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'ma rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics, so get this dick, I'ma live this
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
Life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle, as Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, too many now
To send my serenity powers, spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up and spitted him out, girl giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-s-stutter, mothafucka? Fuck them all, he shuts
The whole motha****** ' Wal-Mart d-d-down
Every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9Like a mothafuckin' chick underwater, he tryin' d-d-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated, just by the way
That you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it
And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say "The whole rap game passed away"
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator, meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Might wanna back up data, runnin' over hip hop
In a verbal tractor trailer
Homie this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader, homie they spent
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes, what girl
I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
Life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)

Yo,
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boone's Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin, "Let's get it on!"
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum (oh)
Smacked this whore for talkin crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin a hot dog readin the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to king-dom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers
We lovin the broads, there's nothin to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source
It's fight music
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the precint sayin, "You hear that?"
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin
It's fight music!These beads I'm swingin is stingin 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin 'em
If any nigga lookin too hard, we Rodney King'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin, right when your wife's lookin
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin your life music!If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis
Watch me, cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me
I came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
to grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called.This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid
It's fight music!

"Encore / Curtains Down"
(feat. Dr. Dre, 50 Cent)Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to50 cent, come on!Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me Haha, bye bye!
See you in hell, fuckers.

See you in hell, fuckers.

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though
Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the night's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because alls I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless it's fucked, when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
With a balance beam. If I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish, childish things
Without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin' for the crowds
They're screaming in The Palace, sold out this evening
But now as I lay me down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
Cause this ice layer
I skate on's a nice way of putting it, but I like stayin'
Feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
It's funny, this house is quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, vicious cycle ain't it?!
Then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line
This goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back
To me
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I
don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
But I keep walkin' the line...

It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name, Ever, first name, Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothin' to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm Forever Mr. West In The Building Ain't No Question You About To Kill Em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'
You'd think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at All
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last Oh!
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me, so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, son
Just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name, Ever, first name, Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothin' to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm Forever Mr. West In The Building Ain't No Question You About To Kill Em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'
You'd think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at All
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last Oh!
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'

Y'all know me, still the same O.G.
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggaz wit' no cheese
No deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles
And no ski's
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family
With groceries
Got a crib wit' a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Mother, fuck tha police"
Gave you tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't gettin' no sleep
so fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucki' around wit' me
And turn me back to the old me
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they Forgot About Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they Forgot About Dre
So what do you say to somebody you hate
(What?)
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
(Yup)
Then just study a tape of N.W.A.One day I was walkin' by, wit' a Walkman on
When I caught a guy, give me an awkward eye
(What you lookin' at?)
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot
Wit' his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out wit' two broken legs, tryin' to walk it off
"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops"I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit' a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
(Right here)
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit' a Charleston Chew
Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they Forgot About Dre
If it was up to me
You muh'fuckers would stop comin' up to me
Wit' your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of
(Compton)I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit' a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?I ain't havin' that, this is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap! You can have it back
So where's all the Madd Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped wit' gats
When you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs"
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause I disassembled the body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside Mc
Donald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see...I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

(feat. Obie Trice)Obie, yo', i'm sick, damn, you straight dog...[CHORUS]That's why I ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick,
that's how dudes be getting sick, that's how dicks be getting drips, falling victims to this
shit, from these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs, that's why I ain't got no
time...[Obie Trice]
Yo', I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk, I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights
tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of
seen this, big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion, sizin'
up the figure while my shit getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga,
caressin' this bitch, plus i'm checking out them tit's, sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used
to buyin', I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's
another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in
juice, the womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the
hottest block, don't stop, the response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',
kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, I gotta slow down before I
cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I
wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like
some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than
conditions of us black folks, we in the final stretch, the last part of sex, I bust a fat ass
nut, then I woke up next, like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and
all, just picked up and vacated, now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected, and Doctor
Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit...[CHORUS][Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch,
before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me
to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to
any violence of any sort, but what's she shovin' me for, doesn't she love me no more, wasn't she
huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this
whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby
in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone
else, and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the
plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a
hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,
you've been holdin' your dick, so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then
the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace, and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby
it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you
gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love
her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,
Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin'
from Obie's penis, she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius, she g'd us...[CHORUS]I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches, fuck 'em all, get money, Shady records, Obie Trice, Eminem,
motherfucker, new millenium shit, yeah, turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off...

Yo, mic check my dick
Testing
One, two, ffff-fuck
My dick, my nuts
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does
You see me standin' outside of your building screamin'
"Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted 'cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin' to get my porno career started
Every place and event
Been There, Done That
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
"Come on, let's go!"
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson one: throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two: face 'em and diss 'em
Don't give 'em a demo
Kidnap 'em and make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson three: get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
Lesson four: 'know you heard this before
"Hey let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure!"
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key
But when you see me on the street I ain't givin' you shit, bitch
Don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin' like Master P
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me, uh
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said "see ya"
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash? 'Fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a bunch of shit you wished you had?
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! I was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip Mystikal's voicebox out, scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah, I don't think this guy is well"
I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
and walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had?
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I know that makes you real mad, don't it?
That's right, Slim Shady
Sway & Tech
Sprayin' wreck
And we don't give a heck
Or a damn
Or a fuck
Or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin' dick

Yo, mic check my dick

I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, til I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep, in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cuz we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reason, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin Englais
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too!Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)

Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...
...Go to sleep bitch!We got you niggaz, nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta tell ya, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...
...Go to sleep bitch!Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy-going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gone bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?Now go to sleep bitch!

Ahhhhhhhhhh! Hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for like Philly
I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating and I'm debating
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself
Too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying
Around with the idea of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, shit
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened at you? Can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he fights first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills
Yeah 'em, tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes man
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man but just think how bananas
You'd be, you'd be an animal too, if you were trapped
In this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah, homie, come on, don't look now
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah, baby, hold me down
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm going through)(But I just keep on going through changes)
Wake up in the hospital
Full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)

Here we go, a get in, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in it
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like say 19 and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the date
I can hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core
But the pain I'm in, after you I swore
To make the gray skies in
Here comes the rays like wind
You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?
It's like the dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you"
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, "You're the good guy," they like, they like
They like, "You're the good guy"

Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah), sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch), eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo), wanna be whoever did it
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say that we're cut from the same cloth but I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the latter day saints
Manic states, even padded with automatic stay pray
Gat anything that may stay in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a tray eh, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman can't take anymore
But I try to get away from the anger and rage my basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs ain't givin' ways ankle
The ways you chumps don't even know how to do somethin' to give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat if you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell the-
Bar for me what I rap, is it there?
But, guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell you
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
But you better take it back to the shelter and Hamburger Helper 'cause dammit I'm still the...Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I misprounouced a name
"DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck! I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by monks
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window, somebody better child-proof it'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Ya'll fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not-gonna-ever
I'll never let up on the pedal might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wiping everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I fee like I'm the...Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest
Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like I flunked suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped ISIS with a ISIS flag, bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that I'm finna hip back 'til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic like similar to pistol squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine drinking, when slim gets mean
Bars on these boys when I split them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'ma sting like a bee you ain't harming a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing, I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali 'cause I know one day I'm gonna be the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do
Is listen she's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-
-ite to the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
I remember it clearly, even today
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma nan
Always itching for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the wizard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go complete ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent
We are the underground empire
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written, opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch
In a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim, it's not cordial
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind, now I got my pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, hopping over that opposition
Looking like a dog is pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, like stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian La
Dainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your bluebirds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this discouraging
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells and doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first, and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst, revenge of a nerds
They will not escape my vengeance
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the Uncle Ron, I'm turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched up your arm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning, return of the no good and I don't quit
And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane
And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, so you can't pop your head
I'm not so sure I want to know from once it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Alright, stop! Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
"But who are you?"
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it, before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit
Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit?
Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?
Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
Not over this shit
Stop!
Drop the biscuit
Don't even listen to Slim, yo
He's bad for you
You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude
Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play
Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick, I slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine years old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
Alright, calm down
Relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat!
Cut this bitch's head off!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright, Shady
Maybe he's right, Grady but think about the baby, before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it
Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did
Be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker!
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A? Mr. AK, coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Alright, stop! Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
"But who are you?"
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it, before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit
Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit?
Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?
Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
Not over this shit
Stop!
Drop the biscuit
Don't even listen to Slim, yo
He's bad for you
You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude
Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play
Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick, I slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine years old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
Alright, calm down
Relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat!
Cut this bitch's head off!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright, Shady
Maybe he's right, Grady but think about the baby, before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it
Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did
Be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker!
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A? Mr. AK, coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?

Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to...I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
It's like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone
I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over

The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to...I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
It's like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone
I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Yo, I can't sing but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
Somedays I sit staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here?
Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't (want her)
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside
Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'?
But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cause my baby knows that her dad's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
Told you I can't sing
Oh, well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there?
Guess what? Daddy's here
And I ain't going nowhere
Baby, I love you

Yo, I can't sing but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

And I ain't going nowhere
Baby, I love you

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve
(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine
A car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama...I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life, (start over)
one without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls, so I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy

Lady you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you can set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you I actually
said to myself, "I gotta meet her like a taxi"
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf, I feel like a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem in fact
About the only fact I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following back
About six cars back, I'm in the lac
And I want to (uh)All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're vile
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running...
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire...)Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But those jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
Pull up behind you while you're leaving
and you don't even know it (ayo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit
But she wasn't aware, I was there,
or maybe she was, and just didn't care
Who knows, at least that isn't up in the air
It's something to see
But just like a chick who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her
What is a brighter ass if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina?Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said...All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're vile
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running...All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire...)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shover stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
Cause it just died like "ooh, food coloring, duh"
So let's get turnt, like a shish kebab, twist it Ma
Like an Air Conditioning knob
We be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water, I bet you get your self esteem
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put
the mother chumps on the back burner
You got puns, I got asperger's
Just let me rest my head in between that set of Ds
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred me in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my predigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle finger, to finger you
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're vile
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running...
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
On the ones and twos, threes and four (the morning)
Rick's in the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
(Who the fuck, it's my big dick,
so everybody get ready right fucking now)

I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door
Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose

I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door
Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose

Welcome back, to the stage of history(Eminem)
Yo. Slim Shady!
Yo. I fuckin.I
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
you think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't a fuckin G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you,
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gas just strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down(J-Black)
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Northface
Nickle nine at my waist, on the Lord's faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?Chorus 1/2(Announcer)
Maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!(Masta Ace)
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
Chorus(J-Black)
But every time I take a step, it gets dim.

Hello... Allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady; it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you
You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill, and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feelin' you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Att-ack-tack-tacking a whore with the damn hatchet
A napsack pack with like 40-some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Forumula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil' friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people gimme 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales, see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
(Word, word, word, word, word, word, word)
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up, muscle relaxers
For his back, and a couple of Paxils, now he's doubling backwards
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone
Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Hello... Allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady; it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you

So i changed, huh
You got a phone,
Pick it up, call me
How come, we don't even talk no more,
And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
We were so young,
So full of life and vibrance,
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,
So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you succumbed to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch is just like ice,And your eyes is the look of resentment,I can sense it and I don't like it
How come, we don't even talk no more,And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,
'Fore I let him disrespect me,
Or check me up with somethin' worse,
Some bitch that I wasn't with,
I would'a hit her to quit,
But you were plain talkin' to her,
And tell her she was the shit,
I told you don't get involved with her,
You were smoking the cron'c with her,
Coming out'a the bar with her,
Stumblin' half drunk,
Like y'all was husband or wife or somthin',But me catchin' her kissin other guys,Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,
Like you want it with me,When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,
You actin' like I ain't your man,
And lyin' like she can't be loose,
But I am really your friend,
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
Don't hate the game or the playa',
The one that's changin is you
How come, we don't even talk no more,
And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
We gettin lonely at the top
cuz my homie had to stop
now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch, get ta speakin all rude
fools i used to rap with, all expect magic
like my finger get ta snappin and poof it just happen
but Proof its just actin, at the party were stoned
shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends
forever, real intelligence, thats forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) when you talk its with bitter respite
(And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life
and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face
How come, we don't even talk no more,
And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you

You still love me?
take this. you ready? 1. 2. 3! the more you, put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at mei know it's sad but it's makin me happythe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me oncuz you love me, and i love you more.
it's sick, but who could ever predict
we'd be doin' the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we don't
we do it for us, it's lust
cuz neither one of us trusts each other
so we fuck 'til we bust
then we cuss each other, out
we know what it's about
shout 'til i throw you out the house
you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch
punch you in the mouth
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
and apologize afterlaughter, pain, it's insanewe're back in the same chapter againand it's sad but it's truewhen i'm layin' here with you
there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.
the more you, put me throughthe more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at mei know it's sad but it's makin me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me, and i love you more.
cuz i hate you, do you hate me?
good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you
and just throw you on the bed
and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people, and i fuck other people
you a slut but i'm equal, i'm a mutt
we're both evil in our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cuz one of us would have one up on the other
so forget it
we can make accusations, people spread rumors
but they ain't got proof
'til they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me
but you gotta believe me to a degree
cuz if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin' it
yeah i would cuz the sex is too damn good
if i ran who would i run tothat would be this soft and warm
so it's off and on, usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope, the only reason that i copeis cuz of that factand plus i can bust in thatand that's why...
the more you, put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you morei buy you flowers, you throw 'em at mei know it's sad but it's makin me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me, and i love you more.
I could never understand it
that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die
it's silly ho why must we try
is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff
try to pull each other's legs
until the other begs
we're liein' to ourselves
that's the beauty of it yeah
cuz we truly love each other
that's why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other
every other fuckin' night
and it's clear it ain't gonna change
it's pent up rage
we both have
we both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else
we've both been
someone else's someone else
problem is neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up
there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the timeon every song, every lyric, and every rhyme
all the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoopwhat you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo
but i won't be made a fool of
if this is true love
you wouldn't do what
you did last timeyou wouldn't screw upthis timecuz this time girli'm tellin you what
you do it again i'm fuckin you up
no matter what...
what you say, what you do
i'ma hunt you down 'til i find youno matter where you run, i'll be right there
right behind you, in your nightmares
all the flowers, and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
you say you hate me, you gon' hate me more
when you find out, you can't escape me whore.
the more you, put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me, and i love you more.

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubt's start to creep in, everyday is so gray and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for em
They just say it's wack
They don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon hug me
But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause...I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so I'm puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck's sake...I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them I don't see none of 'em
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream 'Dre, don't leave us like that man' cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell like "Hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell"
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's milkbox
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?It sucks, too much press, I'm stressed
Too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess
I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No)Was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong
Whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say "Hi"Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E
'Cuz MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now was it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch
What? My mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
That's why they call me Slim Shady

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens the music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
I've been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Tryin' to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind
From smokin' 'em with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
All high and indo scented
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me
They call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back
(I'm back)

I take seven (kids) from (Columbine)
Stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes that they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine
What's my name?I'm Slim Shady
(I'm)
I'm back

Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt
Fuck

[Sample]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid and deadly vaults
Ohh...
Ohh...
*guess, who's back*
I said 'Ohh',...
I said 'Ohh',...
*guess, who's back*
I said man, damn, ohh
*guess, who's back*
Damn it feels good to be back, I'm having a relapse
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, Pop a Xana-x, relax
Tryna stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist get gassed
Man, it's kickass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of face
And take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin'
Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you makin', ain't you? Well, thank you Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shovin' the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me the 18 month old baby to shake 'em up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breakin' his neck in eightysome places Baby, he's Shady comes lady
He's got the razor-b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-s-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling m-m-mumbling dum-dum
Yeah, here I come-come, do you hear the rumbling? Vrum-vrum
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
My head and torso are some won' where they come from
Who's it belong to, maybe the girl with the long blonde
hair, who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's some' wrong 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing. Where is she? Something fishy is goin' on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough?
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl?
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed "Fuck the world!"Slim Shady, so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, no I wanna be killed twice
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet?
So bring the money by tonight cause your wife said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a "fuck you letter"I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!
I told you I was Shady
Y'all didn't believe me
I'm Shady!
And that's my name

"Life" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
Put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't looking
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs, wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop lives"But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
Y'know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Y'know what I'm saying?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Y'know what I'm saying?
And right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay
Y'know what I'm saying?
But hey, it's cool though
Y'know what I'm saying?
I'm just fed up
That's my word

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell like "Hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell"
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's milkbox
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?It sucks, too much press, I'm stressed
Too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess
I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No)Was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong
Whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say "Hi"Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E
'Cuz MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now was it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch
What? My mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens the music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
I've been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Tryin' to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind
From smokin' 'em with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
All high and indo scented
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me
They call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back

I take seven (kids) from (Columbine)
Stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes that they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine
What's my name?I'm Slim Shady
(I'm)
I'm back

Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt
Fuck

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough?
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl?
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed "Fuck the world!"Slim Shady, so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, no I wanna be killed twice
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet?
So bring the money by tonight cause your wife said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a "fuck you letter"I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
I'm Shady!
I told you I was Shady
Y'all didn't believe me
I'm Shady!
And that's my name

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
I'm backing up my shit
As much shit in the car as
I can fit and I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, to all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm starting life again
Kids in the corner won't stop fuck am I going?
Besides psycho when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive because there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
Fuck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to where I was and perhaps,this could've been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream
As a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate
Teenager to a still raging adult
Amazing
Back then I put everything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy, or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Blame me, I did it (Did what?) Hailie,
Baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent, of what I rapped about
Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating
Shady, and entertaining, for real life, but this
Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the craziest, (shit I)
Ever seen and back then, it was like I ain't even
Bother to taken into consideration
You and baby would get older and older
and may hear me say things
I did it.Pay me and beef just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and Jenner, men just strip away everything
has been the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit
(Or should I?) Start cranking in bitter
Complain, beef and pick up by the same things'Cause when I, look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel the same greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get a ranger or whatever this road takes me
Is making me crazy, What's in my...In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
(Till forever, till forever)We represent the 313you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, they don't know shit about this, for the '96[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland;[Hook]I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it;Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminatorit eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite[Hook]I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it;Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit,and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit;[Hook]I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it;I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it;[Outro]
'95, '96 ('96)
And on and on and on (and on and on)

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid,
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object"
"Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head"
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!You get him? Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppy kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid,
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object"
"Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head"
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!You get him? Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppy kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene
If you could count the skeletons in my closet

50 percent of it's 50 Cent,

But if you even considerin' takin' our label down,
you better find our building
and fly a fuckin plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get to intricate into it,
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
cuz then it's gonna get to the point
where it escalates into some other shit,
then I'm a flip
then I'm a get to
stompin' in my Air Force once,
won't be able to tell if its two purrs or it's one
Cuz it's gone feel like so many feet kickin you,

I don't know what it is or what it could be,
but I get a woody,
when these pussies try to push me
thinkin they gone put me in a position to pickle me
yall tickle me pink,
I think I'd just rather have pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety,

Eye-Kyu: Check it out
Eminem: Hey Kyu!Eye-Kyu:
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)1: Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, QEye-Kyu:
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)2: Eminem
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep

Man, let's go
Hey yo Fif'
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
'Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might just find your career
Come to with eek and I'm just like, oh yeah
See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah

Where the fuck we goin' we're like nowhere
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit 'cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
'Cuz no one wants to walk around stepinin' dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get 'em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velor
Even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would said our clothing line's on fire
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah

Your friends should have known not to front 'round here
Listen kid where I'm from the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man I'm gonna say this one time and get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like out of no where
Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running winding doning and shining you know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around and horse playing
I'm making hits my homies taking hits whose staying
See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah

You don't think they gonna think we're really crazy right?

Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er...Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask De
Shaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Shit, fuck everybody!
Outsidaz
Pacewon
Young Zee
Fuck the entire world!

Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er...Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask De
Shaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck

Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop,

Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah,
No worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay

Touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk

Well I'm sorry,
I don't remember
All I know is this much,
I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle?

Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothing
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinking
It's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women that do crazy things
And if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle?
And Mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eating dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and IJust the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
See, honey
There's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was being mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit trying to climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my daughter
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and IJust the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and IWake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee!
There goes Mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with Dad, no more restraining order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and IJust the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and IJust me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I'm always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby

Okay, how do I say this? (fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for
me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)Yeah, I'm a fucking kamikaze crashing into everything
You beat me Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been going for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul de sac
Window cracked bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome
Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I T-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
I turned on rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I wasn't
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by
Dre's Frankenstein, energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, buy some rope on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryna stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass,
it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, is me rear ending Terreri Bear
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair with every naked stare beware
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serially killing every therapist, is it-Wait, wait, got the eeriest feeling something evil is lurking
I'm no conspiracy theorist but something here is afoot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurement stick (what)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been going for your jugular like Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't sang the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

I'm gonna call this motherfucker

A piece of my ass

And everyone should get along.
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute

Good luck Mr. Shady[Eminem]
Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,
and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?[Eminem]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is vital, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}
His back starts tah - look like the Mc
Donald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?[Eminem]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,
cause I'm bad for you[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
(So, fucked up, right now.)

[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
And everyone should get along.

Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)

But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker

Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile Zach's in a coma

When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
(Ahhh!)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(Ahhh!)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
(Ahhh!)
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
(Ahhh!)
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma!?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore"
"Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You god damn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen' in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'ma kill you!You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
(Ah-haha)
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I've been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ask to rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend?
No! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again
Then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the 10th
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
But that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in
Or I'ma kill you!You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said

'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece!
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that!
I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From that fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the study body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I got the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said "shut up" when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!
Or I'ma kill you!You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Hahaha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you

(Ah-haha)
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why not?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Hahaha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you

You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up!
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordic
Track
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
...Dictionary..."Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzinodie, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells  attempt fails! Budden  L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (let's talk about it)I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
You fuckin'... oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you

Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper, wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch! You move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)Don't make me wake this baby! She don't need to see what I'm bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first, I'm like: "Aight, you wanna throw me out; that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place! Are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said, look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
You think I give a fuck?! Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!)
Sit up front! (We can't just leave Hailie alone! What if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back; well, I will: you'll be in the trunk!So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim! I was only eighteen
That was years ago! I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racing
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a year-old little laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room! Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kidding you?!
You loved him didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!)
(Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!)
(Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you! You did this to us! You did it! it's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes) That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle
He accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced! (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut! (Oh my God!)
So now they both dead, and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note!
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We coulda... hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me Kim! It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you! "Ah, somebody help!"
Don't you get it bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you!
You were supposed to love me!!
Now bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed!!So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head

I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die
I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that(Kings never die)Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes

Kings never die

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my
Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical

Yeah
Shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me
Someone get this aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where is where terrorism and
heroism meets, square up in the streets
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's trying to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny, he'll only unite us
'Cuz nothing drives us inside like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cuz our spirits are crushed
and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come to pull us from the wreckage
That's what we get pride from
When we can't from our stars and stripes cuz
this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch like a scab for scars to heal
And band together for Charolettesville
And for heaven's fallen heroes
Fill his wall with murals
Hit the damn reset, start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get rid of
Get a brand new, better, America
And here's to where we're from
This is where it all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's hope for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the klan, 'cuz they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off, Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ, at all
And all you got are race cards but get
a swastika with your name carved in it
should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just think it played off,
so I guess it pays to feed off the chaos
So basically, you Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruining our country, punk
Or taking our pride from us
You won't define us
'Cuz like a dictionary, things are looking up
So much, got a sprained neck
Know we can rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it mean sitting when they raise the flag
This ain't the Star Spangled Banner
This man praised a statue of General Lee, because
He generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I would have spit on him before
I went to shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal to know that he was gonna try to
Thought he was gonna tear apart a sacred land
We cherish and stand for, so
Hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him, we can be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from
This is where it all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)Here's to the land that raised me
There's hope for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know there's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go
This is where it all began, all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless
I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja crap I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shlit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction
Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mother fucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't try'na have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Step by step, heart to heart

Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted

Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

For all the ladies out there
I never meant to
Give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to
Bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner
Crying

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse's moan
And the further I walked the louder
I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard
Cuz after all this is her place
So I gave her the benefit of the doubt
Think I might be about Busta Busta
The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, there we go, yo
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario, though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for
Anyone, ever, Yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Drake, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin my goddamn Jigga on
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the game of
Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
x2I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called you
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' ferris wheel
Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day"
Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for yah
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah
This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'
I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool that pity the fool in me, I'mma live with the game of
Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head left my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
x2So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatched my housekey off my keychain
She jumped off, Wee-Bey from The Wire, escape
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day, cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes
Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
But them other F-U-C-K's all would of hit the off ramp
So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree
Now here she comes at full speed, she's racin' at me
Okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'
I body slam her onto the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Bury this stink ho in it, then payed to have the street re-paved
Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event
I said "hit the road" and after she left
I sent that bitch a text
I said "be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident"
She glanced to look at it and write, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace
Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling "rape"
So the vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late
Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of
Wait dinner at eight
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of
Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what

You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man
Niggas, I'm still grinding
(Yeah)
I'm still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this
(For sure)And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back
(Ain't goin' nowhere man)We got them craps going on and that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Lovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is it my nigga, this what we boast about
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(I don't love you bitch)
I wanna hold you in the morning
(Ha)
Hold you through the night
(Ha ha ha)I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns)
I wanna hold you in the morning
(We wanna love money)
Hold you through the night
(Ha, we don't wanna love bitches though)There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't Zane enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole 'Kit and Kaboodle'
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero-uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night
(And all the bitches say)I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow
It's about the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too
I roll like a bus, 9-11 pulse same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gonna front, I thought R-Kelly was tha shit
Then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn, right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin' rape
I'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose
(Goddamn)Used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats
(Uh, huh)
That boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B'more to deep throat
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I love the burners, the monies, the bunnies)
Hold you through the night
(I just wanna hold you)I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night
(Yeah)

You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man
Niggas, I'm still grinding

(Goddamn)Used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats
(Uh, huh)
That boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B'more to deep throat
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I love the burners, the monies, the bunnies)
Hold you through the night
(I just wanna hold you)I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night
(Yeah)

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight
'till we turn this mother out than apologize after, laughter
Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
'Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people
You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evil in our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumours
But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the two of us
You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to
that would be this soft and warm? So it's off and on
Usually more off then on but at least we know that we
Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck
without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope
Is 'cuz of that fact and I can bust in that, and that's why
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try
Is it really so rough that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we both been someone else's someone else
The problem is neither one wants help, it's an addiction
And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up
There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts 'cuz the pieces to the puzzle don'tfit
And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song
Every lyric and every rhyme, all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo
What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what
You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter
What you say, what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run, i'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So much for them flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb, which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated till my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out
Killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this Earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch
What the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missin', than probably one of us broke in
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it"
"It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying
God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no Hip-Hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb, which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated till my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out
Killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this Earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch
What the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missin', than probably one of us broke in
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it"
"It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying
God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no Hip-Hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah[Chorus 1: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo![Chorus 2: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (Ayy)
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me "Cujo" (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)[Chorus 3: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy[Chorus 2: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

You know I just don't get it, last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me? Ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty six year old skinny Cartman
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New kids on the block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you fagots in public
I'ma love it
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin', "I don't care, just bite me"
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin faggots)And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' fagots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim anus you damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots
'Cuz I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone, if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC get bizzy
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter (your attorney Fred Gibson's a) faggot!
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Here, XXL, XXL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
'Cuz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
'Cuz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me

Maxine! (Phone Rings)Maxine: Hello
Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine?
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do
Verse 1: Eminem
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!)Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it. just. slows. down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
Verse 3: 3
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch.
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said "Oh it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said "Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
I got up out
Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money,
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see.
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking.
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it.
It's like... I've got the whole world, in my palms
and I'm ready to (drop bombs)Welcome to the Slim Shady mecca rebeca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy well I'm
Next to the guy with nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter than I guess I'll
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends
All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole you kidding?
I'll pee on Rihanna see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy gluin' Madonna
To the lazy boy sofa fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right in the quicksand
Here you need a hand big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words geez
So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please
Eminem I'm coming to kill you Inhale
I always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes my superman costume Inhale
Doesn't even fit you
They don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far Inhale
Who do you think you are?
Hang up my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
The world is mine

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it.
It's like... I've got the whole world, in my palms
and I'm ready to (drop bombs)Welcome to the Slim Shady mecca rebeca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy well I'm
Next to the guy with nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter than I guess I'll
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends
All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole you kidding?
I'll pee on Rihanna see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy gluin' Madonna
To the lazy boy sofa fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right in the quicksand
Here you need a hand big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words geez
So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please
Eminem I'm coming to kill you Inhale
I always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes my superman costume Inhale
Doesn't even fit you
They don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far Inhale
Who do you think you are?
Hang up my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end

The world is mine

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up
And stuck them under the tree
And said some of them were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money
For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you can go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work
You and mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone
Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like your sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are
And daddy's still here
Laney I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise
Mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdy's neck
I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat
Don't fuck with dad, haha

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...
It feels so good to be back.I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something,
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
Cause I told you to fight.Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard

All I see is murder murder, my mind state -
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate -
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
But shit is in my hands, here's your life span
For what your life's worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove in thru somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin': "Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "TRUCE TRUCE!"
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
But shit is in my hands, here's your life span
For what your life's worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'

Yo
Yeah girl
Can you hear that
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy
Take a nap
You're not afraid, of the dark, are ya
You hear the beat
As it makes ya
Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door
It's locked so I go to creep'Round the back with binoculars
Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry
She smells like taco's
I want to eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows
Also sweet
With sugar plums
Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey
A holiday ham
See 'em sprinkled on toast
With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers
With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper
Is all that I am
My music box
When the lights are off
I see the girl's asleep
But I'm waiting my love
Keep calling me
We're worlds apart
But you mean the world to me
I almost look comatose
Who wants to be sober? gross
I foam like a doberman
Mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils
In both my holes then i plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size
My eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up
Get naked and run around
Waving the gun around
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder
How come it rains but the sun is out?The Devil's upset with his wife
They must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out
What the fuck I'm 'bout?
Voices are leading me up to the attic
I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse
The sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest
But what do I do it's locked?
I pick it and open it
But it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up
And the tune it starts
It's playing a song
So beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full
I smell a funeral guess I'll loom in the park
My music box
When the lights are off
I see the girl's asleep
But I'm waiting my love
Keep calling me
We're worlds apart
But you mean the world to me
I'm fixated
On asphyxiating
And breakin' this little chick's neck
Like a pixie stick
The sick, satan worshippin'
Bitches get horse whippin'
I'm in the back
Through the back
Door slippin'
Through the crack
Leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love
Sent from above
Forced and treat 'em all
When she no more stingy I've become
Been doing this for more than a quarter century
I'm just numb
Am I dreamin'? is it real?
Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come
To tie her up
Dada roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window look at her
The crime is slow to shatter
Her brain matter and batter her
With a bat a matter of fact
That will splatter her
But before i do that
I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back
Like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer
I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight
But you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight
As I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs
Simple as that cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens
Then pan back the camera
Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack
So Pamela
My music box

Yeah... Oh! Yeah Yeah... Oh. I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high
Ok here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic-toc so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack, with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my little vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show, and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
Your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row
Put 'em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate
And which model which lake they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid what wife and which nun
Don't stop I like this it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryin' to light
Behind the boards sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some get behind a Linn drum
Make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer so unbelievable it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of sur-
prises when the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

Yeah... Oh! Yeah Yeah... Oh. I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high

So much for first single on this one
Shady's the label
Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come outta-erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Ms. Butterworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves
Just for no reason other than-uh just to tease him
Cause he was his biggest fan
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem you wait 'til we meet up again
Fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said!"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show
Ready get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow
So look out below, Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop I don't know
Tryna pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know
anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game
That shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Furman tapes
In a safe, locked them away
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
Cuz one day it could cost you your name
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle

Janine just turned 15 and used a fake ID
to sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled to cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory Dirk Diggler
Look at me work wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka jer-jer-jerkin' the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
What am I sayin', allow me to run it back and rewind it
rrrbb
Wait
Lemme ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain
Am I berzerk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Workin' the damn camera filmin' one of them
Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an anglechicka-chicka
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin'When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them
Cause they coulda sworn someone said "nuh-"And then tried to erase and record over it
But, if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
uhh-uhh and then they come-to find out it was-Justin

And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock bawka-bi-kaw
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick
And stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off

So look out below, Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop I don't know
Tryna pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know
anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game
That shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Furman tapes
In a safe, locked them away
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
Cuz one day it could cost you your name
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No

Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare nakedchicka-chicka-chicka
Janine just turned 15 and used a fake ID
to sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled to cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory Dirk Diggler
Look at me work wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka jer-jer-jerkin' the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
What am I sayin', allow me to run it back and rewind it
rrrbb
Wait
Lemme ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain
Am I berzerk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Workin' the damn camera filmin' one of them
Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an anglechicka-chicka
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin'When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them
Cause they coulda sworn someone said "nuh-"And then tried to erase and record over it
But, if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
uhh-uhh and then they come-to find out it was-Justin
sayin' "I'm gon-na come" 'n' this was, su-pposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so

Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock bawka-bi-kaw
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick
And stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off
fucka-fuck offf!
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because...These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup? Ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby"
They're all like, "Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please let me suck your cock"
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because...These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band, my band!You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
'Cause my shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap, see, it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks whiling get whipped on my back
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best!
You know what, man? I'ma say something
Ayo Em! (You got somethin' to say?!) Man, nuttin
I thought you 'bout to tell him off, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Ayo, it's...) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude, I love your band!)
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag!) Bitch, carry your own!
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
"Lose Yourself" video - I was in the back
"Superman" video - I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! Ask us the questions!
Like who's D12? How we get started?
(What about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name
(Man, fuck this!)These chicks don't even know the name of my band
(Ha ha!) But they're all on me
Like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall!)
'Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the *mumbles*My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band, my band!The hottest boy band in the world - D12!I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go?

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a Daddy?
I'll bet you do!
Who's your Daddy?Daddy, what are you doing?Haha
Okay, then!Everybody, listen up!I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you to show you there ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off 'n' got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autographed
Sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lying my ass off
All this time me and Dre have been fucking with hats off
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these russians, and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop?When will I knock the crap off?Hailie, tell 'em, baby
My dad's lost it!There's really nothin' else to say, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby?I think my dad's gone crazy!
Theres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!It's like my mother always told me
Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana
And codeine and goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Uhhh...
Fuck that shit, bitch!Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy and have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flows, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.OI wouldn't have to go, eene-meene-minie-moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more!?
Dad!There's really nothin' else to say here, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby?I think my dad's gone crazy!
Theres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See, what you're seeing is a genius at work which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade
Standing on Ronnie's grave, screaming at the sky till clouds gather
It's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
The parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
There's really nothin' else to say here, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby?
I think my dad gone crazy!
Theres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!
...Crazy
Ha ha ha ha!
You're funny, Daddy!

Ah, Ahh
Yeah, look
If I woulda rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your
Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like
My competition I mean, right?
Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT
B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali
Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome
I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey
Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison
And make a noise like snake before I kill him
And let him know that I just don't feel him
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
And the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes
123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body"Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here
Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Hahahahaha
Dye it back, come on, try it" AHHHHHHHHH
No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you", But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for eachother
Think about your mother", yeah so what of her?
"Well think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes...", fuck you motherfucker!
I had you beat "No I was playin' possom, remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your souls mine
I'm taking it back", you fucking bitch WHY!"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? haha"My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body"Shady, listen... "SHADY!", you hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"But I don't want it back! "Yes you do..."
No I don't! "Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!"
No I won't! "I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now!"You're lying, "yo slim", HOW, WHY NOW!
Whatup Dre? "Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya
I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya
Drugs, you became a lot softer"
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
"Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up"
Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
"Put the gun down", BYE BYE!
Ok I'm still alive, "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you, prayed to god
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through
Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!
Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too
That you're just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill
Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall..." WHAT! "no one's gonna love you like I do!"My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I said, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music
Told me she was goin' back into usin' again
I said "Wait, first try this hallucinogen"
"It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin"
"Come here, let's go in here"
"Who's in the den?"
"It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, let's try another room"
"I don't trust you!"
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom"
"This'll help you get in touch with your roots""We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods""Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drag""Oh, dag! I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag!"I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

"Get away from me! I don't know you!"
"Oh, shoot!"
"She's tripping"
"I need to go puke"
"I wasn't trying to turn this into something major"
"I just wanted to make you appreciate nature""Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya"
"The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya"
"So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth""That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out"
She said "Help me, I think I'm having a seizure!"
I said "I'm high too, bitch! Quit grabbing my t-shirt!""Will you calm down? You're starting to scare me"She said "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married!"
"I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!""I'm over here Sue, you're talking to the plant, look""We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late"
"'Cause I've never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault, my fault"Susan! Where you going, you better be careful"
"Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled!""I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue"
"Want some gum? Put down the scissors before you do something dumb"
"I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?"
"I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these""John! Where's Dave at before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom, I think he's taking a crap, dude"
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance"
"There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off"
"And there's only two days left of spring break, how long does it take for these things to wear off?""Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she eat the other twentytwo caps"
"Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die, dude!""I know! And it's my fault!"I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
"I'm sorry!"
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

That's why I on what I on cause I'm my mom.My mom my mom I know you're probably tired of hearing about my mom Oh ho! Whoa ho!
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty and how I became hooked on va-al-ya-hum

Hi!

Can I have the attention of the class
For one second
Hi kids!
Do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady you a base-head!"
Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
Come here, slut!
"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!Hi!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me
"Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it

Stop the tape!
This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi kids!
Do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady you a base-head!"
Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
Come here, slut!
"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!Hi!

I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler

Just won't shut up will you,
Talkin' bout I owe you,
Bitch you owe me, I'm promoting you right now.
Lets put the nail in this coffin.I dont wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but I'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
and old men have heart attacks
and I don't wanna be responsible for that
so put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
I would never claim to be no
Ray Benzino
an 83 year old, fake Pacino
so how can he hold me over some balcony
without throwing his lower back out
as soon as he goes to lift me
please don't, you'll probably fall with me
and our asses' will both be history
but then again you finally get your wish
cause you'll be all over the street like 50 cent
fucking punk, pussy, fuck you chump
give me a one-on-one see if I don't fuck you up
tryin' to jump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
and you put Jada on a track, thats how much you suck dick in the industry
swear that you in the streets hustling
you sit behind a fucking desk at the Source butt kissing
and begging muthafuckas for guest appearances
and you cant even get the clearance
cause real lyricists dont even respect you or take you serious
it's not that we dont like you... we hate you period

and askin' me what i know about inditement, bite me!
Bitch i got 2 case's and probation, Fight me!
what do i know about standing in front of a judge, like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he, has
what you know about your wife slicing her wrists
right in front of the only thing you have in this world,
a little girl
and i'll put that on her
when this is all over
i would never try to make her a star, and eat off her
i don't shit about no shopping rocks
but what you know about hip-hop, shops, rocking spots
When you're the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping
pressing up your own flyers, and your stickers, sticking
them bitches up after spending 6 hours at kinkos
making copies of you're covers of cassette singles
to sell 'em out of the trunk of your tracer
spending your whole pay check on disc makers
what you know about being bullied over half your life
oh thats right, you should know what thats like, you're half white
vanilla ice spill the beans and rice, I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ
If you're that much of a gangsta put the mic down
you should be out killing muthafuckas right now
kill a muthafucka dead, kill him dead bitch
shoot him in the fucking head, go ahead bitch
slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
she can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
cause you're broke as fuck, you suck
you're a fucking joke, if you was really selling coke
well then what the fuck you stop for dummy!
if you slew some crack
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap
you'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
you'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch aint it
Rayman, here let me me break this shit down in layman's
terms for you just to make sure

You can still have a little bit of dignityhaha, talkin' about i have muthafuckas callin' your crib

You ain't even got a fucking phone, you fucking bum

And fuck your little magazine to, i don't need your little fucking magazine

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubt's start to creep in, everyday is so gray and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for em
They just say it's wack
They don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon hug me
But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause...I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so I'm puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck's sake...I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them I don't see none of 'em
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream 'Dre, don't leave us like that man' cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.

You're drunk, the coffee is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that
Why do I always come back
Oh
What I wouldn't do for you
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Some nights I wanna run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh
What I wouldn't do for you
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Starting to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
You remind me of mother
We drive one another as crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no
excuse for the games we play with each other
Where you at? At a friends?
No you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her, cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble,
she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheating again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian River cause I'm in denial
Say I don't need shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
Cause I'd rather believe a lie then
breathe a sigh of relieve that I don't believe in
Going to bed mad
I keep on trying to make a bad girl good
But have a nice goodbye, you in good times
In bed, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead
Cause I literally feel like you could die of a "should I?"
Leave me for good? You never would
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And I think you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fuckin foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
of the trouble you get yourself in
I miss trouble but I can't leave
I'd never sell you out
I'd never turn my back on you
What the fuck is that?
I'm co-dependant
I'm just now noticing it
But how every time I go to end it I don't have the cahoney's to do it
Nor the heart, uh, department store
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've had a non-stop score cause somebody paired us up
But people say he ain't capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Denaun what up man?
What up dog?
Ya alright?
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Bus didn't come here did it?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store right man quick cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look.
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, you know what i'm sayin I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean.
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what they look, I'm sick of taking this darn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich,
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car,
you know what I'm saying?
I still stay with my mom, 21 and still with my mom
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,
you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke
Verse 1:
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this crap ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When this shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it
Yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying,
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man,
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?Verse 2:
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
f*** with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star
Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player,
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once
ninety six baby

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hop in your whip and take a sip then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cumin'
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my tele, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike
Suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael oh Lord
You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La proxima yo se que mejor me quedo sola
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola
I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, no skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing by

In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is Destiny, yes money I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Till I get a call that god's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standin' across from me, no apologies
My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozenyou don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to
the subs
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah I'ma basket case but I mastered this rap shit, 'till my ass gets wasted
'till my
Assassination
'Till I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
44 Mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then...This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MCIt's what he'll do just to see if he still has it
And if his skill's mastered
He's able to spill raps long after his killed, that's a real MC
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I didn't have this outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing and mourning
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
They don't know cause they don't see that I'm wounded
All they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartooneded
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
An they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', and you too, you can
Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it dont even beat
So expect no apologies

In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)You (don't hurt me no more)That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get 'em
I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as
I begin to spaz with the pen,I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit,now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cuz
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?Snatch the mic from him,
bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah the rap is tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
In the place all the way to the parking lot,
fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow
Til I'm toppling from the top
I'm not going to stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)When you so good that you can't say it
Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless
I smell blood, I don't give a fuck
Keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to
see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)You (don't hurt me no more)That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you

Yeah... ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (wha?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin'
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "EVERYBODY GET OUT"!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..."
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch!
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one...)Ain't nobody iller than me
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast...

Yo, how do I keep (I don't know what's up with these hoes)
Getting in relationships like this (I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
Should I look in the mirror?I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together
She thinks I'm bein' mean
And now she starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zoning to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hoplessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of before I go to sleep
Sike
Hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats
Told her she's heartless
She's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep a hun
We all but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
I picked someone that's so unlock-able and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids
But I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringing up that one time she
Tried to two time me
And throw it up in her face till I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
to a motherfucking crime scene
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree you fucking bitch
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me flip little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita
Fajita slut treat just like a drum
Beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!I love you but I hope you fucking die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your i
Phone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off and then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?

Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Yeah, It's been a ride...

You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Yeah
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, i
Pod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-Fed, i
Hop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spyder move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Capri styles, am I a G?
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)Y'all in the stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down
We can no give a fuck, shit, a fucking Kehlani
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya it Vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants
You niggasBrain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, i
Pod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, i
Hop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy)
The people you run with are fucking (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery, bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put up
Strap on, in other words if you're a gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
It's tough to me now, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfucker, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady 'bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy, cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Soldier in my soul and I told them the moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, it's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is groper, I roleplay with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Roll dice to globe in and I'm also not ready tryna throw in the colt
They both hate to choke and my hoe play the soak
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formiddable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, solider
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One mother older
Sponge, mob, colder
None, rug, hoaster
Lug, nut, coaster
Lung, jug roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic
(Man, fuck this shit; let's go)

Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, youth always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
I feel sorry for this beat
Sympathy pains for this track
This road is taking me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Ridley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff grows
Half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast but that doesn't scare us
We pass no one, we're failures
Cause we're just
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, youth always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
Cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
Fuck doing what you're told
Act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways
For emcees it's a funeral when I'm devising this rhyme
Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts bravado nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
Cause some stuff that's awful really don't mean nothing all though
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place
It's prob'ly cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life
Avoid or veer or just steer toward it
We're only looking forward but
Where we're going, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical
It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire
Was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine but you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault is torture, it's more severe
Go to war with me or end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up blewn in your North Korea
All in all, it's said and done
And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come
To the Pine box, bitch fuck you
I'm better than I ever was
Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but
I'm not gonna sweat it cause this
World's screwed, it's already fucked and I'm on top
So everyone's just
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted youth always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
Cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
You can't tell us nothing
Hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young, i'm ready for love
Who knows what the future for us could hold, i'm ready for love
Another shooter, Uh oh
And more tomorrow's we're done
And all we are is
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted youth always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
Cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast

[Royce] What? Uhh..
[Em] The Bad..
[Royce] Yeah..
[Em] The Evil..
[Royce] Right, yo
[Em] put em together
Chorus: Royce the 5-9, Eminem[Royce] Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin to strip
[Em] If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin to chew
[Royce] Yo..
[both] I'm just fuckin with you, cause I got nothin to do[Eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off
and slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your A&R in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (Fed
Ex)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
when the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN?[Royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
only about two-thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible
Chorus: 2X[Eminem]
*yawns* Forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated
it takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your career
and walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
I'll throw you off of ten floors .. *AHHHHHHH*
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Gettin skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screamin,
"Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin here!"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine
cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'[Royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
with a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
Chorus 2X[Em] The Bad.. the Evil..
The Bad.. the Evil..

[Royce] What? Uhh..

You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible
Chorus: 2X[Eminem]
*yawns* Forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated
it takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your career
and walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
I'll throw you off of ten floors .. *AHHHHHHH*
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Gettin skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screamin,
"Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin here!"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine
cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'[Royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
with a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
Chorus 2X[Em] The Bad.. the Evil..
The Bad.. the Evil..

[Royce] What? Uhh..
[Em] The Bad..
[Royce] Yeah..
[Em] The Evil..
[Royce] Right, yo
[Em] put em together
Chorus: Royce the 5-9, Eminem[Royce] Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin to strip
[Em] If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin to chew
[Royce] Yo..
[both] I'm just fuckin with you, cause I got nothin to do[Eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off
and slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your A&R in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (Fed
Ex)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
when the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN?[Royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
only about two-thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

Chorus 2X[Em] The Bad.. the Evil..
The Bad.. the Evil..

Yo
(Yo)
Look!
(Yo)(1)
Eminem-
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
One of the worst things
Is fat, bald men decided to write songs
And teach Mouseketeers to sing
I'll stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
(Bitch!)
You aware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?)
Fool who visits the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pissed with a whip with a Marseburg
With a pistol grip and fed pit bull shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich I just get sued
Redman-
Yo I leave with no injure
After I blow four one in ya
One handstand on top of your ninja
Crashin' Doc stir the madness
We all out of work like Tony Atlas
Walking with cans in a laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossin' we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm out of work but Doc laid them off
(Shit! The power's out)
The tape is off
Yo who target it from arsonists?
Paper make pens filled with arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc can shave up, cut your barber miss?
I turn out camps in to crystal lakes
And fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
Cause that's what white boy Tyno do
(2)Eminem-
So how's everybody doing tonight?
Hope you in the mood to get drunk
To screw and to fight
Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this
(3)Redman-
So how's everybody feeling tonight?Hope you in the mood to get rude
And illin' to fight
Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump
(1)Redman-Yo when my gat spit it hospital son admitted
Rip your lips off kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc, Marshall Math's.
(Print it!)
weed, ex, and the acid tabs did it
I'm what's happening with no rerun
Doc rob Dinero when the heat come
My barrel hangs out the Camero
Aimed at the nose when them hoes is hard to breathe from
Flash the gat your town bow guarded
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit an airplane pilot
We pound you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Paclypse and them
It's like Funk Doctor
Eminem-Mr. Punk Rocker
Got the drug stock inside the lunch box
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Pop the trunk and pull out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good
Thank God for vodka
But with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a Fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With an automatic calling me up there
My man Stan with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a damn tinted Sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich or your canned spinach or Spam
You gotta sip through a straw
Shop lift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma maybe I'll give you a call
SIKE! YOU FUCKING BITCH!
Suck a dick and two balls
I'm giving you all my shocking script
Which is to piss a priest off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene to pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well be a painting smashed on the floor
(3)
(2)
(1)
Eminem-
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
No matter, OH!

You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call that shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby is in robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of
the club like, "Oh my God, he's trippin'"
Only time you get the blade is probably
with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will,
popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch Mc
Connell
Just as big of a bitch it's Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up'Til everybody eats my turds
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the sanny, Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
And ham trending, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio
of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blow-up doll and Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled, so's my manager
Bitch I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these raid blinds
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he Face
Times
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You couldn't eat citrus the same size
As the blade I push into Caputo when I...
Pull 'em like... sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds
Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a 10, you're an 8
Like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like a lonely partner that blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get to soakin', try to get to poke a hole in
Why you hoes be off? And nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass
'Fore the pen,
I stood up for the kid who had to put up
with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go
shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a
mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich,
all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head and if I hunted for the bread
And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for
the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
I'm Dre from back in the day from
from black and the grey from
Chokin' a bitch to smacking her face from
Stackin' up bodies to racking AKs up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady far as competition faggot there ain't none
Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades vrun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, the great one
Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray A1So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go [(you are now smoking with the best, the best)]I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go [(you are now smoking with the best, the best)]Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless, a nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin
Vin vin, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat and no clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
That when you wake in the morning next to the porcelain
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go [(you are now smoking with the best, the best)]I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go [(you are now smoking with the best, the best)]Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
Nah-ah he ain't playing
He's gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSIIt's as easy as pie and as simple as cake
Dre get on the mic and make them tremble and shake
Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and coke
And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You muthafuckers ain't smoking you just holding shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees
Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
Come on smoke me up cuz, get me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady man come on back (what?)
Man we're losing him, he won't even respond back fuck
Now look at all the pretty women in here [(Damn, bitches)]
Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures
I get the thermometer you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bit
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go [(you are now smoking with the best, the best)]I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break

Yeah, ya know? Critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man?
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'mma tell 'em
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow
So ya better get to blowin in flow rider
Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick, I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song it's a warnin' to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mr Mathers is the man
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy
And stash it in a can, come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through
Anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think
That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine
Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen the brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a belemic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut boo
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare
I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it save it, psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetrucks on fire, homie
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, your on fire
You're on fire

Yeah, ya know? Critics man

I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin' back
(Oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?
(What are you doin'?)
What?
Proof, the projects, nigga
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife?)
Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex(Kuniva you awright)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin'
(Don't leave me)I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsuhi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von, he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No, I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender
(There's plenty of shots to go)
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsuhi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off

I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin' back
(Oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?
(What are you doin'?)
What?
Proof, the projects, nigga
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife?)
Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex(Kuniva you awright)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin'
(Don't leave me)I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsuhi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von, he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No, I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender
(There's plenty of shots to go)
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsuhi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man,
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you whack!
What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first,
you can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first,
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first,
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say,
I'm fresh, I'm fresh
Thyme:
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knives
Jacking lives of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You best just set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be, and
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache, wither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fishermen's sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence (take offense)
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest
Chorus: Thyme
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo let me get that mic man'
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit

(E) = eminem as eminem
(D) = eminem as his mom
Here's the story... Of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Tryin to cope with everyday life
He lives in a little house
That was built in the middle of the street(E) Hey mom tupac's on the juke box
(D) So what, he shot 2 cops
And raped a little girl watchin news watch
(E) Nuh ahh they were tryna frame him
(D) You and that Tu Pac shakur
(E) No that ain't how you say his name mom
You're so lame. Dont you know anything?
(D) Yeah i know you probably doin joint in a gang
(E) Yeah right, I'm out wheres my fuckin walkman at?
(D) Stop Cussin at me!
(E) Shut up bitch!
(D) Quit Talkin Black!
(E) Well slammed the door and I'm out
Now what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket
I forgot it was winter
I'm Gettin Thinner
I'm hungry, is mom cookin dinner?
Mom let me back in i forgot my coat!
Mom come on I'm not playin its cold!
Aight sorry I need a jacket
Mom look! My Tu
Pac tape I just cracked it!
Mom please let me back in
It is Tu
Pac Shakur
I just asked him!
I'm Freezing (*sneeze*) I'm Sneezing
I'm breathing to much cold air
I'm Wheezing
I ain't did nothin
I ain't say im leaving
I said I'm goin on the front porch to get something! (*cutting noises*)
(D) Aight Here Take Your Damn Coat And Leave!
(E) Fine I'll leav--Mom You Cut Off The Sleaves!Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(1, 2, 3)
In the middle of the street(E) My teacher's two faced
He went to lower all my school grades
Cuz last thursday i had a tooth ache from kool-aid
So mom kicked me out
(D) Get Out!
(E) All i had was my suitcase,
A shoelace, a tube sock
And a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
Cuz i could go to a freinds
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather be home
In my own room, Alone
beatin my shit
And nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is."
But as soon as mom found it
I would either get grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
I'm still countin!
Even when I was under age...
Mom was tellin cops i was tryna run away...
I told her "Some day bitch, you gonna pay..."
Please mom please mom please I wanna stay...
(Let me stay!)Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(yo)
In the middle of the street(E) My brothers incoharent
Moms a single parent
Who ain't caring, staring through me like I'm transparant
Made it clear that i was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that i was the son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
(D) Please sell my stepson cigarettes so i can smoke.
(E) One time i tried to fake a stich to get attention.
Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengence
My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
Mom says "white rappers always get laughed at"
Not only that, she heard me upstairs and i can't rap
But I'm stupid
I'll never make it average or a D+
I need to sit on my ass
And just sue people like she does
One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
Mom sued and got $2, 000 from Ballpark
Hey mom you got a doller?
(D) I don't Think so
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm Going to bingo
(E) But mom you said. you were broke
(D) who said?
You got your ears messed up (awwww)
From that damn rap music
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street

In this white mans world
I'm simmilar to a squirral
Lookin for a slut

Tied up in a knot

Hey Em, it's Paul
Uh, listen I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the 'Just Lose It' video
And um, I mean he's pissed so I-I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this, um
Oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um, they heard a rumor that you got a new gun, um
I know it's probably not true, but I just need to talk to you about that
So, uh, give me a call

So, uh, give me a call

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
Step into the unknown and find yourself
You're floating freely, no emotion
Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

I can hear your heartbeat, your scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll cripple you
Just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Nine, Trey Pound or 44
Pick a strap to take the Mac
The hawk I'll stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips'll hit ya chest
You cough up blood to EMS
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a strecther
'Cause I'll come in ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system out I done been through with
There's nothing new there to me
They locked me up they left me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come and get at 9
Nigga crown me a perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it
Man these are average raps
I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady aftermath clique
You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the octamom to death with a cabbage patch kid
Attack a snatch ya there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over jack is back again
The rippers at your service
Girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface
Like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard
Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog,
How late you wanna stay out,It's past your curfew when it's dark
I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month
They found a coat all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace
No DNA no not a drop
Cause me and dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops
Grab the butcher knife from off the counter top
Yeah, I'm as I'll as can be
My appeal is to serial killers
What a pill is to me,
Killing so villainously,
Still as maniacal on the Ny
Quil going psycho
It's michael myers,
You know what were like on the muthafucking mic,
So try us and your gonna find out,
What the fuck were like with pliers,It's operation time got em
ed up to wires,
Squeeze em, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead,
He must not know but now he now how Shady Aftermath is,
Even murderous tactics get better with practice,
Lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn,
Truly ours Juliard, you better learn learn,Chris Reeves in his grave,
Yeah homie turn turn,
I'm debating, mutilating the lady,
You've been waiting for shady and fif,
Ain't no duplicating it baby,
There's a baby in the drier,
There's a torso in the washer,
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,
Arms and legs in the garbage cause the rest of her,
I lost her,
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,
And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub,When I'm through with Ricky it'll will be blood that'll cough up
A hard rock soft fuck [? ]
Get caught up and get washed up,
In Detroit or Northfolk,
When it's disrupt and nauseas,
Look deep in my eye and see many many many men die,
I swing gym stars faster than samurai,

I guess you could consider it poetry, but with me it started out with just words, just words. They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases. By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer)Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think you would come to find?Maybe in my dreams
I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick taught
Until my inner enemy interrupts
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid who wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Before me and Shady, who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit?
We put the world onto it so watch how you say "fuck me"
You just might jinx yourself, whoops, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)This elite drinker is the ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher
With a street sweeper full of heat seekers
In your Jeep speakers I'mma keep ringers
I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R
Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word
Making work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula has him a spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexing?
Fuck yes with the goon talk
I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street
CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think you would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams
The thought of retiring
Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron
What up ma, I'm applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your openin'
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you're in a lobby in Ireland
And you've probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am in
No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so wrought up inspired
But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars are aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talk intertwined like a beanstalk and a vine
But I keep walkin' the line between wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Dammit, the Pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin
Singin' "Bagpipes from Baghdad" again
In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in a GLAAD bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again
You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again
I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've just thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive colony tryin' to sneak by it
While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line than to
Put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev with bomb pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking Swiss army knife
A saberless Darth Vader with arthritis in a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin'
Like I'm locked up inside of a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie was driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door
Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
And five I hit, ah, shit
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills and green
Big pills, mescaline
(That's ill)I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke
No, oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy)I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?We can't get jobs
'Cos our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real
(Yeah, right)Shut your mouth, you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills

That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno
Fuck it

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow Purple Pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
And five I hit, ah, shit
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight

Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno
Fuck it

Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin to swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall if I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up
Blow this buildin up, I've been sealed enough
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts? Well I'ma show you what,
you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see what you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's feeout this world, ain't no one out there mind as me
You need piece of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme to express how I'm really feelin at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be? The clock strikes midnight, one-two, then half past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave to this trade? Signed out of spit to the grave
Real enough to rill you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smits ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear their jaws was comin
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I had half a chance I'd grab it - Rabbit, run

Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit

Yeah
(Definitely, definitely, definitely, dope, definitely, definitely K-mart)
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line on any fences
If so to what extent
If at any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other peoples' expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic'Cause I ain't got no legs!Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is...
Rain Man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip-ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)

Yeah

Is that gay? I just need to clear things up'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip-ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)

Lights out bitch, odioss, goodnight (blowe)

Think for a minute cause the hype had died down,
That I wont go up in the oval office right now,
And flip whatever ain t tied down upside down,

Tell that seat of laws, tell that slut ta suck a dick,
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck, son of a bitch,
Take away my gun, I m gonna talk some other shit,
Cant tell me shit about the tricks of this trade,
Switch blade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade,
The shits like a samari sword, a censay,

Addenlay, but uck-fay, ick-kay...(eminem)This rap game, this rap game,

But fuck that, I m gonna rap till y all get sick of me,
And clutch my last sack, it s been all who big on me,
I m pickin a rot mix, fuck the dog who single me,
I m saying you motherfuckers, don t know ith, who playin,
If I m broke, then I m brakin open the place where you layin,
You know, same she every nigga done in his life,
I livin this why (??), speak long (??), what I blow when I write,
So why, should i, ever fear another man, if he bleed like I bleed,
Take a piss when he stand, ok you win, you can say we cant rap
But no shots (??), never me (??), you never (??), and I don t wanna (??),
When they say it was wack...I walk in the party and just start bustin,
Right after I hear the last of self destruction,
This liquer makes me wanna blast the chrome,
To let you know that time without morse dangerom (??), (nigga)
I low down and shifty, quickly call swifty,
To do a drive-by on the ten speed with fifty,
You feelin lucky squeeze, I catch you outside of chucky cheese,
With you see (??) who be unlucky g, my lifestyle is unstable,
A partyin addict, they said no fightin in the club
So I brought me a matic, coughin the static,

Pop in the tavern and guns are so just irratic...Believe me, we run this rap shit forchezy,
Make makin millions look easy,
Everywhere you turn you see me,
You hear me.Believe me, you see my pistol and three dead,
No time to call the peace treaty,
Dial 911 cause you need the...,
Police to help you, believe me,I haft to tunnel from the side walk and piss on the curve,
This is obserde, these street nigga s twistin my words,
We finally could say goodbye to hollywood,
Cause boots and shine pants, is nothin in commin,

We never bow down to be a flashin a pig (??),No one must, fuck this statue dawg,
Nothin to do with hands when I clap with yall,
Put your job on the ground (??), then the dog in the pound (??),
Then I m goin out of town, for the law come around,
So we can battle with raps, we can battle gats,
Matter a fact we can battle with placks,(eminem)This rap game(bizarre)I m too fuckin retarted, I don t give a fuck about my dick,
Thats why I m date in raymond bobbet,
My crew had a arguement who was the largest,
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist,
Plus I made the beat to all the raps,
Well I really didnt but I did according to this contract,
I was thrown in the snow with no where to go,
Freezin 20 below forced to join, bail shit, then blow (??),
My little girl, she should nt listen to these lyrics,
Thats why I glued here headphones to her ears,
To make sure she hear it,
If rap don t work I m startin a group with garth brooks,
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
This ain t the hook... (??)

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap
Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C
And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?Little gay-lookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for
Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace, looking boy
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)

Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes[Chorus - Eminem (repeat 2x):]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?[Eminem]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me![Chorus][Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?[Chorus 4X][Eminem]
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things that I never felt
You gotta be the real thing cause you remind me of myself

Motherfuckers -
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don'tthink you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go - he's
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the
RENEGADE! Never been afraid to saywhat's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talkabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE Never been afraid to holler
about anything anything? Anything ANYTHING!
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it - multi before I die (nigga)
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin
RENEGADE! Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk
about anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!
Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE Never been afraid to holler
about anything anything? Anything ANYTHING!
RENEGADE! Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk
about anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!
Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE Never been afraid to holler
about anything anything? Anything ANYTHING!

I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch
But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing(What's your name?) Marshall(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha-ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)No! If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing, even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion
I'm in the style department with a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent and condescending, the king of nonsense
And controversy is on a, beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea, guilty
Cause I sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the...It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)So, yeah, dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas, I appeal to all those walks
Of like, whoever had strife, maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads, the sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock, it might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit, misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out, Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman, going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is: Dad, I'm back at it again, bitch

(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco

That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the...It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)So, yeah, dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas, I appeal to all those walks
Of like, whoever had strife, maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads, the sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock, it might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit, misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out, Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman, going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is: Dad, I'm back at it again, bitch

Once you call my name out
Things will never be the same
They should have never let us
Get off foot in this game
Ever since I was duced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fuckin' pole vault with
Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady, aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally
Understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other?
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers
Who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives, he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nike's, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stompin', I been rompin'
Since Tim Dogg was hollerin' 'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin' Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet
That tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky Ticky Toc, Ticky Ticky Toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop
SONGWRITERS
MARSHALL MATHERS III; LUIS RESTO; STEVEN KING

Aw man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man
You get in a fight
And people you don't even know jump in
You feel like you wanna hit something your fist clinches
You're pissed, you just wanna get someone
Well, shit jump on this, you're 'bout to get your shit pushed in
I'm just inches away, I'm splittin' your shit wide open
No stitches can save, you'll die with your eyes open
You hope this isn't the way you end up going out
But I guess just is I'm afraid razors scissors and blades
Make Jason say isn't this great aww look theres participatin'This ass kickin' debate that's startin' to take place
In the middle of street
Little did you know there'd be an all out brawl
Soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium rushed away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left your house today
Could of made you anticipate such an ass whoopin'
Okay till the anger dissipates, you get punched in the face, reciprocate
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling might big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
You step in a place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit got your gangsters all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's a fucking lighter you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get your shit beat outta you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me you will yeah, got me a pill found me a thrill
I gotta a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill
Girl, howdy how do you feel, ma?
This cock sucker did not spill my drink
Aw hell naw, he must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge
So what the deal ridaz
Now here they all come and they got your back in like two seconds flat
And that's probably a record yeah you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they weren't an army yet there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause they beer they was servin' here was only tapped
I'm biting I fight dirty you might get kicked in the nuts
You fightin' like this guy might hurt me your quiet certain he's nuts
I've hit myself in the face harder play smarter
You may start a roll or you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out of go powder your nose pussy
The louder you yell the more I slap the shit outta you ho's
You said it all faggots so now how do you 'spose
We settle it hit me in the nose and see how it goes
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts
My balls are feeling might big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
It's sheer hustle I bob weave deflate your beer muscles
We are tussled and the crowd starting to cheer us on
Adrenalin's rushing through us just like a gieser gushing
To much Budwieser in my blood
I'm strangling you we fight for nothing
My signatures look are your marks look at you all big with your remarks
As I swing an ice pick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya and break ya down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick as bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous gape that is far
As having me want to rip out your fricken ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch you scratch me with your nails
For that you catch an open hand slap like a female
Like bap in fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12 I don't feel like doing this myself
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling might big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now, homie
I almost feel invincible and shit
Ay Dre, you got me feeling like
I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable, damn

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryna seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you...
Roses are violet, mollys are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
Cuz I think I started hallucinatin'
Cuz I just thought I
heard Jay Electronica & Odd Future's new shit
& all I can do is follow the music
& end up wit Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Filling water balloons wit nail polish remova.
Just a pop 'em and wallow in fumes I...
feel uptight I got to get loosa
Afta I finish polishin' off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cuz all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that hoochie did pass
Ya see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like...
" I'm Marshall"
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya
Oh I'm a mysogonist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
(uh!)
A chronic abuser...
and not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of ya losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, & a nuke
& a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood so...
When I say I'm bringin' the Tech out
I'm not comin' to repair your fucking electronic computers
God...
I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofa
I'm TORE UP...
demolished, I'm fucking stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are... L**Ny Tu
N3$
The box of reusable latex gloves & the socks & the shoes2 replace Nextel-Veronica's boobs& the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in a glove box
In a blue Honda wit used condoms were clues the...
girl was just not the one suitable for...
Right fo' me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for...
you & me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh...
(youralltraptinmyhead!)
Thought Id give in to the pressure
Collapse & crumble...
perhaps relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Cap'n Crunch of rap
& I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
Cuz push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
but that passionate hunger's back
A fantastic juggling act
& the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact...
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fucking crashed my hovercraft
Afta I strapped the duffel bag to my back
& stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, rubber plaster, a thumb tack
& a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic & fuckin' snapped
Jumped & splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back-flipped
& landed on a gymnastic tumble-mat!...
& for my last trick, lunge on back
latch on a N.A.S.A. shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled & laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal& just asked him to come crash& I go grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress& ceramic construction hat, rubbed my magic mushroom tat 4 luckthen splat...
get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapsed
& that's mo' likely than finding someone that's
Right fo' me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be
Just Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for...
you & me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh...
(youralltraptinmyhead!)
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fucking-cumbobulation
Flooded wit thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably sum' of ya got 2 thinking
'You're top 10, ain't ya?' stop cuz ya fuckas are talking crazy
& stop interrupting you're not even up in that conversation!...
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whateva yo job is
I came 2 fuck wit yo occupation
You're thinking just cuz ya came in with scrubs
& ya brought the scalpel & sponge
The oxygen tank & the suction & shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once ya done swapped names wit him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan, if you dug him up -> Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles bacon
a fucking Mc
Donald's egg & cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it & knock it shake it...
Jumped & got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said
FUCK IT!& lost my patience
they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of ya Doctor Dre so then what does it got ya thinking
Ya can fuck wit this operation?! aftamath
still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still plugging along, no need for assumption
Here's confirmation, I'm up fo' the long duration...
I'm just looking fo' sumethin' 2 walk away wit
Sum' pocket change & a lil integrity
Tho' I'll probably be jumping across the stage
Till I'm fucking Madonna's age &...
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit ya not like I'm fucked up wit constipation
That day will come where I finally stumble upon sum' lady thats
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for...
you & me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh...
(youralltraptinmyhead!)

Yo
Yo, I'm just gonna write down 
my first thoughts 
and see where this takes me. 
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world 
in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (blllt)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar
Even have an opinion if you, you mention me
Millions of views, attention the news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give a shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, 
preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut now
When it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks 
you'll just turn around and just be like
"Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad
just 'cause his album sucks 
and now he wants to take it out on us?" 
(ooh)
But last week, 
an ex-fan mailed me a copy of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry
I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumbling but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do, where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole
Or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK, you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to Mc
Donald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned and you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it 'cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be, regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom if I don't
Pull myself from the jaws of defeat
And rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached
My enemies die
I don't ceasefire till at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze"Aw, man!
That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange
Oh my God, that's a reach"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date"
"Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple"
"No it's not, it's a peach!"So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang 
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scared to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person
To see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
They can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been panning my album to death
So I been giving the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck![Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Ayo
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope
Without a circus net
I'm popping percasete
I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect
But I work a sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
That's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up
But there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'Cause when we die we know were all going the same way
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan
Too comfortable and roomy in a six
They threw me in the mix
With all these gloomy lunatics
Walk around depressed
And smoke a pound of ses a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame
That means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screaming like those two cops when Tupac shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
'Cause I never went gold of one song
I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom

Ayo
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope
Without a circus net
I'm popping percasete
I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect
But I work a sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
That's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two, we recording?I'm cancerous so when I diss you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangle you to death then I choke you again
And break your fucking legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'mma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown, 'cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs, that would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people and drink
Jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white?I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave, die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?I slap women and eat 'shrooms then OD
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped
I'm running out the morgue with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there?
I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am ISo when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself

You can be just like me

I'm a little nutty and I know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that I'm
not the only one who's off his rockerthere were many before m
I was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed Igrow to be but if you take a lookat us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree
(haha) alright, look
I'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe Shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did I spit too soon?
Should I of spoon fed 'em it?
but I was just so eager
to prove I was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom I was in every now and then I
look up like I was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was, see
what it was was
I had developed the
complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse,
now I'm next, let's see who
I'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
I get a reaction from,
usually the first thumb was from
Proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied toeach other cause none of us had deals
it was real, we justwanted tickets for that meal
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
it's just mesometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don'tfall too far from the tree
Ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that I had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects
I was like 5, 6, and how come
I remember Malcolm,
Isaac, and Boogie
if it was the projects in Missouri?
cause those're my best
friends until Isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and 70-some stitches
which is still, to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious littlesister who never existed and this is why part of
my life's so twisted
but I can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and, by the way, thatpicture's one of my relatives
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel likeit's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don'tfall too far from the tree
You probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
I say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
I need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me (me)
and I'm not a G, neverclaimed to be
I gave my vest to
Cashis,
he'll need it more than me
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our
way, what do we, turn the othercheek? come on
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody coulda seen this shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me
The minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now

Bury my face in comic books, 'cuz I don't wanna look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylonol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I prolly should 'cuz these problems are piled all at once'Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cuz I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
of my dad 'cuz I hate him so bad
Worst fear that I had was growing up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am

For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame in real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein' a no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had instead
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had instead
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
(Hollywood)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
(Why do I feel this way)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good

This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets I finally got something to shoot at now
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
I follow, hearse after hearse with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let "Billy Dance Dupri"
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
2-0-0-3, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
Why do you hate me?
I came from nothing, blood sweat and tears you did not create me
How can you doubt me?
You don't know shit about me, there'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit!
I struggle for survival and now you trying to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
All the pain (All the pain)
All the agony (All the agony)
All the horror (All the horror)
All the tragedy (All the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life (C'mon!), one day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the fuck... (Who the fuck...)
You think you talking to?
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
2-0-0-3, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could of been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could of snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, stready trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin' to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man (Watch your fucking mouth)I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
2-0-0-3, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
For the last time man, I'm through

Heh, so I'm out the game huh?
Yo Dre, we ridin'?
Whatup
Well I'm wit'ya homie
Okay, well let's handle the small shit
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit
Grew up too quick went through too much knew to much shit
Corrupt and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick 'n' rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n' stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him? Wouldn't be shit
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine?Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
When I see you, I'mma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a buncha little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimmin' pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amatuers drink veteran piss from a dixie cup
If you ever mix me up or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here, play Devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'mma only sucker punch and swing without warnin'
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off 'cause I know, if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm somethin of a phenom, one puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us
C'mon!
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day
But I handle my business 'cause it work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you could have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'mma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks threw that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it and you die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around get annihilated, eyes dialated
Like my old lady!
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my lanch pad
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, then invest in something
To protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'mma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
But I suffocate for the respect 'fore I breath to collect a fuckin check'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck - ti-tick - my dick

I been searching, but you're the one I want in my life baby (4X)Verse 1: Eminem
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you're all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found
CHORUS
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie
CHORUS
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X)
(fades) No one special, special like you (2X)

I don't know man
Just feels like, we're a lot different
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now than you
It feels strange but uhm
I guess this is kinda like, it's kinda like
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, c'mon son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son
Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes, fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction
She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up 'til I get my respect
And I won't stop 'til I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations, aww
That hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her
Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do, It's like a verbal seduction
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like a verbal seduction

Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Alright, cause I brought some friends with me too
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
Trouble! What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
{rapid gunfire} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me
Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
And ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the FUCK you at?
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well, when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?

Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I'ma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck

C'mon, I ain't leaving without you, bitch, your comin' home with me
And my boy, and his boy, and hid boy and his girl... nate dogg

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
'em hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit(Nate dogg)
Two to the one from the one to the three

Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you
I will shit on you
I'll shit on you
Girl you know its true
I'll shit on you
Bitch or man
I'll shit on you
I will shit on you
I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The National Guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll Shit On You!)
I'll shit on you!I will bajs on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit On You!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit On You!)I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch shut your fucking mouth
I'ma keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house
with a chain saw to cut me out
my fuckin' wife
I haven't had sex since I met her
I'm to busy fucking, your 12 year old baby sitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cooking, cleaning
and sucking dick and thats it (I said it)
I was responsible for killing John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who raised me and say the can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
on his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and.I will bajs on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit On You!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit On You!)Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling
My need I stay strangling
I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll Shit On You!)
I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(Hey, hey, hey!)
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You)
So what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out
Niggas get hit with a two piece, "Bling Bling"
With a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing
I will bajs on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit On You!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit On You!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit On You!)Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll Shit On You!)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*Bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy girl dog woman man child
I'll Shit On You!I will shit On You I don't care who you are

I'll shit on you

These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out
Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out
Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out

Yeah, (haha)
you feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too, damn.
You know,
I'm so glad we could spend this time together.
See,
I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?I'm the American dream,
I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with the *rchick-rchick-(chicka-chick)
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'Can't wait to get you into my Benz,
Take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole, story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as, me I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl,
I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing, I got on is my pajamas
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad,
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo,
first I kiss your navel
Work my way down,
baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something, more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate,
this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me,
differentiate me
From these phony little fishy,
and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear, and all the kissy face please
Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager,
Shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that, even better than your mom lady
I told you I'm shady,
you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally, startin' to get the picture, I'm just
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad,
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again(Chicka-chicka)
Call me dynamite, (ohh ohh)
(Chicka-chicka)
Dynamite, (ohh ohh)

'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, (oh oh oh)I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for, your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're
Sweatin', but if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya
Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feelin', of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie
I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back, and throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded, you Couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get the Pineapple Schnapps goin', no one will knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Sayin' don't disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad

Lemme tell you the whole, story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as, me I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl,
I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing, I got on is my pajamas
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad

Work my way down,

But you may want to find something, more stable

You fucking groupie... Pick up the goddamn phone
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio bitch, what'd you do screw Dre?
You went there looking for me, ooh, that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You want to lose two legs?
You try to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you
You say "Okay, yeah, I'm cuckoo, hey?" Well, screw you
And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Oh touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one, true blue ace but you ain't
And I can see you and you make that little boo-boo face
Cause I'm hanging up this phone boo, you make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk, cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, but a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on
Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
Cause you ripped it in two pa-arts, and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you are, bitch? Guess it's time for me
To get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again, I L-L-L-L... Lesbian!
Ahh, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
Cause you told me, you love me, forever, bitch, that was a lie
Now I never, wanted someone, to die, so bad in my fucking life
But fuck it, there's other fish in the sea
And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night, bitch on a scale of, 1 to 10
Shit, I must be the holy grail of, catches
Ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name, de la
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor made for me
Say fuck it kick some shots back, get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failing to latch onto the tail
Of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me, that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi-oi-oi, man oh man, you boy-boy-boy's getting sick of these girls-girls-girls
Oink-oink-oink, you fucking pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead, and I'mma throw a fucking party after this, cause yes...My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you

You fucking groupie... Pick up the goddamn phone

Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Wait a minute!
You hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love?
What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together
I met her on the beach...
Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger
That's not what I want to do
I love her!
And we're gonna be together!
Never

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Da da da da da da
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rap of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do
So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
The confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, you can conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
'Til its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
I love pissing you off, it get's me off
Like my lawyers, when the fucking judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'm violating. All the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch is news
Pistol whipping mother fuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it You sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, cause instead of you murdering
You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt in them
It's like pouring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking at the Hot Rock's parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not cause
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I can do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in 2-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Mother fuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake'Cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't a possible reason I can think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you

We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake'Cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't a possible reason I can think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you

If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back sitting on square one
Trying to pick myself up where I started from
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more sort of chalant type I chose
To more shows, on the true nights I suppose
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as ducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't beleive I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a poopie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewlery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat, as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt, and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me
Yeah, right bitch, spend some time on my dick
In most cases Stat's attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We sufferin' because of this Shorty's on some hole another shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma tricked off rip
I'll admit I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close but who could've predicted to know
Your triflin' way would've stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hoes, nope
Em duced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips"
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some as
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported, you know how I grind
She got the talkin', talkin' like an opportunitist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so badit's not so bad...Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me backjust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grayput your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write to you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in way
I never knew my father neither, he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when i have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cuz I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cuz you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
About that guy, who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't then Phil saw it all then at that show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drownin'
No it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted, was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures of the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was. it was you
Damn!

You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was. it was you
Damn!

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so badit's not so bad...Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me backjust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grayput your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write to you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in way
I never knew my father neither, he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when i have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cuz I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cuz you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
it's not so bad...Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
About that guy, who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't then Phil saw it all then at that show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drownin'
No it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted, was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures of the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I...
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window...
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Yo, follow me, come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go, to this place
The devil only knows, of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold, a world where only some will go
But none return, when will they learn? Where do they go? God only knows (Stay wide awake)Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark; it's Winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape then figure why not try to make your pussy wider?
Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let's see her have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide, girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun outta
Murder and I'd rather go "vinn-vinn!" and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp
Shit, wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold, a world where only some will go
But none return, when will they learn? Where do they go? God only knows (Stay wide awake)So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide-and-seek, like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep, I creep right through the front
See, so blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound sleep
"Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's raping me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scraping me, she's fighting me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's all right with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancing to quite a different drumbeat
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold, a world where only some will go
But none return, when will they learn? Where do they go? God only knows (Stay wide awake)Better try to stay wide awake, or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya
Musta just heard the sound of my stomach growling from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler; bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fucking Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold, a world where only some will go

Its 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge
Watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it
Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was running shit till we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was going through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hoping they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died
So did the group
If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz
Rockstar was the shit
Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did
More than try talking you into coming up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we would've politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washing my sins in it till my conscious is clear
If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
Bacardi in hand
Never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodying shit but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from raining cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinking of all the artists you gift
All the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get?
For turning your fucking back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift
A Freudian slip
Subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words
But I guess they're just owning for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here
But that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to
But I'm fighting for air
I'm barely charting myself
Feels like I'm under the sink
But it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road
Done all we possibly can
I know we kept up our hopes up
But the longer we spend living this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take
Better take some more
Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Waiting for a light that never comes When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead There comes that day it's 'off with his head'
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Waiting for a light that never comes And I told them: 'nah you don't know me'
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors Say it's all you can take
Better take some more
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Waiting for a light that never comes The nights go on

Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent...?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like
to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?But, I...I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
You know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big-screen T.V.s, blunts, 40's and bitches.
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicodin
I mean-
I can't sell this shit!

Either change the record or it's not coming out!

to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?But, I...I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
You know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big-screen T.V.s, blunts, 40's and bitches.
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicodin
I mean-
I can't sell this shit!
What...
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What, I...
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I supposed...
NOW!
Alright man...
Whatever

'eyyy!Hey Em, what's up?Steve Berman. What's goin' on, man, how you doin'?
Good to see you again. What's up?
Em, could you come in here and have a seat, please?
Umm, yeah, what's...
Vanessa? Shut the door (Ok)
So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
Wh...
This album is less than nothing. I can't sell this fucking record
Wha...
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent...?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like
to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?But, I...I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
You know why Dre's record was so successful?

Alright man...
Whatever

A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you
Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck
I'm zoning off of one joint stopping a limo
Hopped in the window, shopping a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword, body pierce with this
Living amok, never giving a fuck
Gimme the keys, I'm drunk and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and burying guns in the mud
I've calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightning this time
For all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your Mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match
"Here momma, try 'em on"
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strapping a motherfucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my Momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck, I was born during an earthquake
For all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

Hey, listen
I love my job, it makes me feel like, Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blond
'Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone re building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy? Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make, "Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain'Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But it's inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

(Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell... fuck you)(Eminem)
I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy!
(Ok I'm Re-Loaded!) Go Bring Jay-Z!
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him!) Over Dre's Beats!
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (AHHH!)
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
But I didn't take nothing (Thanks!)
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, cause I was pickin' strange places to aim from
(Mad Rapper: Man, I bet you 50 bucks you won't jump out the window
Shady)
(Crash) (Ahhhh!) Pay me(Madd Rapper)
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed (Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turnstyles, then run from po po
Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is (CRAZY!)
Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is (CRAZY!)(Madd Rapper)
Yo yo, i wish I'd been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin to sell a O', my pops tryin' to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs (God Dammit Spike!)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like...
(Eh... Oh... Dude... That shit's crazy man... oohhhh... This is incredible... ohhh...)
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy Withe dude and u need some help, word(Eminem)
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you eight stitches, what I'm gay cause I hate bitches?
Slut dont be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And i'll still be mad at the world, even if it apoligized to me (Sorry!)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin' brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin' Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shoppin' at toy stores **whistling**
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at u, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, dont vacuum!Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is (CRAZY!)
Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is (CRAZY!)

You used to say that I'd never be
Nothing without you and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died, it was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda
It's like you put a, knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the, other side
Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign
Of life in me for the, first time since you left me
And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda, had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now
So I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was

"Ha ha ha, talk to me"
You want me to tell you somethin'?
"Uh huh"
I know what you wanna hear
I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Oh boy, you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, hoe'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway, hoe

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Oh boy, you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
"I'm not phazed"
"I hang around big stars all day"
"I don't see what the big deal is anyway"
"You're just plain ol' Marshall to me"Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
"Hailie Jade? I love that name"
"Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"Rotten pieces?"
"Aww that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good lordy-wody, you must be gone off that water bottle

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go

Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit

You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something - fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end
It ain't over 'til I say it's over - enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
Cause this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter - I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut, what?
Like I give a fuck but I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win, biting the dust, it'll just make me angrier
Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it - it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure, cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then A-chieve!This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
.Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
Oh, this my jam, this my shit
We don't know a word to a verse,
All we know is the chorus
'Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new emphasis on our syllables
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
Than I'm gonna feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
'Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her, "We're in press heaven"
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu, Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong syllable
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting 'cause ever since then it's been innocence
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
It's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook(Wait, Dre, look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be 'cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, riding on lolo's
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodo's, that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked lock,
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beat behind me playing, so you ain't hear anyway
You don't hear what I'm saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I'll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much
And Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the "Fuck off"s
All y'all eat salt, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New syllables eat ball, you fucks off's
Your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off
East, south, midwest, even up north
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk
Shady made me for bringing it back
For the history of rap
It's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
What happened to just spitting about living in the motherfucking city you at
In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you could never be
It's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you
It is not about lyrics anymore,
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot, hot, hot beat
And a catchy hook
A hot, hot, hot beat
And a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some god-damn records

Yo... Dre Man.Make my vocals sound sexy,
Come on man, come on man, okaaaay,It feels so wrong cause it feels so right,
But its all right, its ok with me,
I'll do my steps all by myself,
I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance,
I can put you in a trance the way I dance,
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome
I'm that guy man,
Shove a diamond up my hind end,
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals,
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles,
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl,
Now lets cuddle,
Blood curdling your gurgling on your blood,
What I do for my next trick,
Im feeling won-der-ful,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kids butthole,
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her,
In my spiderman mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on,
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon,
Are those pistachio's damn, I'd like to have some,
Laying on the patio man, rolling a fat one,Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on,
God damn man are you that much of an asshole,It feels so wrong cause it feels so right,
But its all right, its ok with me,
I'll do my steps all by myself,
I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance,I can put you in a trance the way I dance,
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome
I'm like Houdini,
Tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie,
Make the shit disappear like tara reid in a bikini, believe me homie,
You don't know the meaning of a meanie,
They call me the fruit loop from jupiter,
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot,
Dont move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far up in your uvula
You aint gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus,
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier,
Weenier smoothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice,
You should've seen it mother,I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card,
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie-o-Donnell's
With Mc
Donald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos.It feels so wrong cause it feels so right,
But its all right, its ok with me,
I'll do my steps all by myself,I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance,
I can put you in a trance the way I dance,
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome
Shady what are you doing chewing on a human,
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM!
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a racoon,
Skewing a rat a cat screwing a baboon,
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom,
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance ooh,
But their afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for,
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk?
Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed,
Kelly Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet,
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed,
You like graffiti dike, well I can pee pee and write your name,It feels so wrong cause it feels so right,But its all right, its ok with me,
I'll do my steps all by myself,
I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance,
I can put you in a trance the way I dance,
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome
Fine nobody wants to play with me
Fuck you then bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going' tell my mom... mom...

Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazyyeah
woah woah waoh
woah woah woah
So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one
I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through,
growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' And I wasn't
anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it
Feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me,
and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy
So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one
Marshall you're no longer the man,
that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing,
self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talking to myself)But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater,
I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado,
he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of Mc
Donald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem,
your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady,
I'm fucking going crazy
Is anybody out there?It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one
So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs,
Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up all over
my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm BACK!
Ha ha

Chorus: Now I don't really care what you call me You can even call me cold These bitches know as soon as they saw me Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go Still I ball like there's no tomorrow good nights its over and thats all she wrote
1st Verse: Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate, Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape Cupid shot his arrow and missed Wait Sarah you're late, your train left. Mascara and eggs smeared on your face Nights over goodbye, hoe I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up, Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her, She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up. She must've took me for some high roller. But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' roll cola. Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars You get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly So why would i buy you a gayass teddy bear,bitch you're already bi-polar
(Chorus)
2nd Verse: Man TIP told me on this hoe tip, best tip I could give you to hip you Never let these traits trick you Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit Dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch Shit you talk about some adivce that sticks with you If i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns Like double stick, its you but fuck 'em TIP, its cold Its chilling like and feeling like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you Before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch You think this is some Nintendo game how f-cking dumb is you I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump somes with you So here's a penny for your thoughts But it won't buy you a chesseburger, although a nickle might just get you one pickle Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue Thats a bombshell, scud missle! I got this cuss at you to fucking cuss at you Like before I rap there was some motherfucking stud Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle So fuck sissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister
(Chorus
3rd Verse: I guess life is a bitch aint it tip And each one thinks they the shit Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankercheif I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine Let em get a good taste of it I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, But in case you didnt Imma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it So I pace this shit a little bit quicker That clock I'm racing and double timing it But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time It may take you pricks to catch on While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog And they say Mc
Donalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong But if you gon tell me that the A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg
(Chorus)

I'm gonna kill this bitch
Im'a kill him
I'm going to fucking jail
'Cuz I'm gonna kill this bitch
(Yo man)
What?
(I donno)
(I got a really really bad feelin' about this)
Man, would you shut the fuck up, Dave?
You always got a bad feelin', man
That's her car, right there
(Aight, let me park)
Just park!
(I'm parkin'!)
Fuckin'...
Turn the car off, dogg
(Aight)
All right, we wait
(We wait for what)
We wait 'til she comes out and then I'm gonna fuckin' kill her
(Man, you ain't gonna kill no one)
Man, shut the fuck up, dogg
(What the fuck did you bring that for!?)
Just shut up!
The fuckin clip is empty
(Man, don't point that shit at me)
I'ts not even loaded, bitch, look
(Dude!)
(God, I fuckin' hate it when you do that shit)
Yeah, but it's funny as fuck!
(Muthafucka... I'm gonna kill you one of these days, I swear)
Gets you everytime
Is that her?
(Where?)
Right there, mothafucka
(Oh, yeah)
Aight, get down, get down
(Fuck! what you doin' to her?)
Get down!
(What the fuck! You want me to get under the car?)
Yo, who she walkin' with?
(How the fuck am I suppose to know, you told me to duck down!)
It's the fuckin' bouncer
Did she just kiss him?
(I don't think so)
Dogg, she just fuckin' kissed him!
(No, she didn't)
She's kissin' him, dogg!
(No, she's not!)
(Ohh shit!)
Come on!
Fucker!

I'm a little nutty and I know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that I'm
not the only one who's off his rockerthere were many before m
I was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed Igrow to be but if you take a lookat us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree
(haha) alright, look
I'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe Shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did I spit too soon?
Should I of spoon fed 'em it?
but I was just so eager
to prove I was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom I was in every now and then I
look up like I was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was, see
what it was was
I had developed the
complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse,
now I'm next, let's see who
I'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
I get a reaction from,
usually the first thumb was from
Proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied toeach other cause none of us had deals
it was real, we justwanted tickets for that meal
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
it's just mesometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don'tfall too far from the tree
Ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that I had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects
I was like 5, 6, and how come
I remember Malcolm,
Isaac, and Boogie
if it was the projects in Missouri?
cause those're my best
friends until Isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and 70-some stitches
which is still, to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious littlesister who never existed and this is why part of
my life's so twisted
but I can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and, by the way, thatpicture's one of my relatives
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel likeit's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don'tfall too far from the tree
You probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
I say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
I need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me (me)
and I'm not a G, neverclaimed to be
I gave my vest to
Cashis,
he'll need it more than me
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our
way, what do we, turn the othercheek? come on
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

...Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause...And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from Out
Kast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Until the roof
(Until the roof)
The roof comes off
(The roof comes off)
Until my legs
(Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault, I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for
All my life, I was told, I was never nothin' special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm fallin' helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a livin' hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's meltin' me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves memy friends, what do they know?It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just somethin' about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seein' me happy destroys her in itself
To see me fallin' to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say "screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's runnin' through her
I can see the light, now I'm runnin' to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standin' there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fuckin' thing on fire, then she threw it
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

You sit there stone faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach
A wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you
Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's set, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a
(She don't give a shit)Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good
All you are to me
Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's set, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a
(She don't give a shit)Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse
And I'm sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Tangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside
She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a
(She don't give a shit)
Maybe I'm a twisted one that screwing this up
So I guess this means Goodbye, for now

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost

Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron

My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

(Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
- Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin', nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets, ah-sap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
- We stranglin' the rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a loony
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
- I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

Weed laced with somethin', nigga pass that

The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets, ah-sap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a loony
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid
twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'- Bitch it's too late
- 'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
- I'm an instigator, 3-80 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it, for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight
- So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit

A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know but I do know I'm back now
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
60 sluts, all of them dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes he can, I just did, faggot
Now guess again, better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy, especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty, Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy; no, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be, the fucking Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville calamity, goddamn it
Insanity pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
"Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me"
'til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're taking a pee!Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground6 semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can-opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah, glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I didn't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Biting into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is striking, it might be a fuckin' sign, I need a psychic
Evaluation, Fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th!
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and begging to stay
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Tell the critics I'm back and comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult, with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his power
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine and sat him
In the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm street with a fucking Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands, too
Came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple-fat goose
Insanity, can it be vanity? Where is the humanity
In having a twisted fantasy with an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred eight brackets
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to
Get it? Headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground- So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this
And now I'm 90 days clean and uh, that's all I have to share
Thanks

When you walked through the door you were queer to me

You just hurt my god damn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, trying to play games, see the saw blade
See the silhouette, of a stalker in your walk way, better cooperate
Or get sautéed, and rotisserie, while you're hog tied
MCs get so quiet, you can hear em all fucking dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin on that ass like the fuckin fall guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwi
Cuz it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women & men
Vrrrrrn vrrrn! motor so big you can fit a midget in its engine
Bitch gimme them digits while your cringin'
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spen-spend even ten cents on you
Since when do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit if I think a penny's pretty
Just image how beautiful, a quarter is to me
Ee-nee-mee-nee-my-nee-moe, catch an eskimo by his toe
While he's tryin to roll a snowball but, don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go ya'll(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
Get up baby get a move on, like a u-haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil, I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin chicken 'fore it hatches
Cuz, you can bet your ass that, we gonna get it crackin
Like the Kraken & Titans, when they clash and
Get your brains bashin so bad
You gonna have Kurt Cobain asking to autograph on a blood stained napkin
Unfashionable, about as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for the shit, gif my dick, Google it till it pops up
Ya'll are so motherfuckin full of shit that your stocked up
Me, I'm always shittin diarrhea at the mouth
Till your speakers crap out (pthhhhp)Ha, what? Girl you got a hot butt, like a lit cigarette (Chit- chigarette)
But you won't get a hot fudge Sunday from me
So do not strut my way slut, because...
(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
Ima show you why I came, so you stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut-cunt-whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers
Cuz I'm a fuckin' (problem), run boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word, hat you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like a killed Kenny, gas in the tank? Yeah still plenty
No morals, are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out Hannibal, Understandable why you're jealous
Fuckin' animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist 'em now can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand ya flow Understand my flow?Bitch I flow, like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy
Don't you dare try to follow or compare boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass
In ya trunk elephant (Hemorrhoids)
And remember boys...
(You don't own me) Now here we go, go, go
Thank you for coming out. Hope you enjoyed the show.
Until next time... peace.

Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, profiled
And then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably coming from the dope house
We can let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hiding that Heidi Klum on you
And you're on another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue,
we got that tried and true pistol drew
right at you we be delighted to unload it
In your bedroom, walk up, and lay that taser in the side of you
What the fuck am I gonna do?
I keep telling myself keep doing like you're doing
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why?'Cause you're a white boy, white boy
You're a rockstar (My momma talk to me
Try to tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car (But I don't listen to her
'Cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy,
you're untouchable (The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up
We bought to roll up, and
Throw your ass in the van, cuffed
You don't have to know our plan or what our intentions are
Our guns are close to our chest
You better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
And you'll get shot in the thyroid, 'cause you might die, boy
We fighting a crime war
Here come the swine
Tryna' clean up these streets from all these minorities
That's why we call them pigstye's for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like you're a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts, and
Get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins
It like we're drifting back into the 60s
Having black-skin is risky, 'cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-American's have been treated like shit
And I admit,
there have been times where it's been embarrassing to be a'Cause you're a white boy, white boy
You're a rockstar (My momma talk to me
Try to tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car (But I don't listen to her
'Cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy,
you're untouchable (The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)Pt. IISeems like, the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice that of a black life-spanner
Wonder if sometimes it has a fight scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape my circumstance
I'd rather hear them say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better to describe banter
But that's life
Strapped, 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying for Mc
Donald's
It seems like the only franchise that'll
hire, so how can we have higher standards
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence
But acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes wack lives madder
At cops and cops madder
And that's why it's at a stalemate
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyard offices
Not the crook spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act pissed off at us a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for good cops
And man, stop, sending white cops, into black neighborhoods
'Cause they ain't acclimated to 'em
Like that's the way to do it
Who's seen some videos of rappers waving guns
And no nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism
Fear to the black face gives them
A subconscious racist
Wait, why is there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us
Designated us, to an area
Separated us
Section-eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, every days another
Freddie Grey for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape
The sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies
In
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, its like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in, these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers and bears oh my! More like billy clubs and
Gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause
We're black
"But you kill each other, facts- you peel each
Others caps, for silly stuff like hats"
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck is the boots?
And streets act as a narrator
Don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that just to be black,
you better be strapped,
with a derringer- or be "capped in America" like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one overseas, these cops, and
Always see some B charges
We see them beat Rodney King and got off
So we don't need all your crooked police peace offerings
Just keep marching, til' we reach congress
But they gonna say you're tying to take an
irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag
But someone has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kapernick tantrum if
you don't stand for the national anthem
We raised it,
you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the bravest still, racist spills
So the whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that it was
foundation on based on united states ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singing the Star Spangled Banner to a piece of cloth
that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build

I got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off till you
Scream, piss off, screw you
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like
Knock knock, let the devil in, malevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinning and this medicine
Screaming, "L-l-l-let us in"
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatin, think my skeleton's melting
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Element glue, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerance and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, metal in
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor in the, motel then
Dr. Dre said: Hell yeah
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care, I
Barely could wait to hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my
Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the)Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pin
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?
Danica Patrick
Through the car into reverse at the end of the nut ration
And you look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed
Much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the
Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the)Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)I said, "Knock knock, let the devil in, alien"
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're stepping in with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot
Tied for the uppercut
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losing their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the)Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so...[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's  a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's De
Shaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

...Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause...And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Eminem:
S-S-Shady Records, you better believe the HYPE is real...'Yeah! Yeah! Shots to Soul Assasins! DJ MUGZ... Alchemist...Chorus:
Niggas know what i'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cuz i don't have to
You can run your own mouth, i don't care
If you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here, to be scared
A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it aint considered a crim unless they catch you
We all die 1 day...Obie Trice:
Niggas, when i step up in the bar, faggots's wanna look
Like you muthafuckas got Obie Trice shook
Like i'ma stand here as a man
and let some queer-ass funny lookin nigga get the upper hand
I got issues... got no time
Got guns than more niggas moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas rides
Everybody runnin' for they muthafuckin lives
Tough Club niggas? we leave early
Cock back shirley, open up ya fade
your gray brain needs motor city paid
Your nervous system still twitch on days; these
ho's and animals?'s get merked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you 'play the ball hard'
Trust in God cuz you's about to have a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
a .45 that'll lite niggas up
and this .45 high make me not give a fuck
Chorus:Lloyd Banks:
But as long as i'm here i'm gon' grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make ya ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last bet
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
if thats the case, then get a bigger one
You dont think i pack the 'bump' cuz i'm out the hood
that's a stereotype, like everybody that's black can jump
i'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic and them
I'm out in dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish i'm established 'til the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on a train
I travel first class, you aint ever got a TV on your plane
ssh, be easy on my name
cuz i aint goin bank n forth
your boss and ya captains's soft
Chorus:Eminem:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
Man when we gon' hit 'em
chew 'em up and spit 'em out
too much venom
and if you roll wit em
we gon' fuck you up wit 'em
i got too much momentum
movin in my direction to lose
my shoes'll explode as soon as you go to step in 'em *BOOM!*
You know how we do it when we do how we do it
and we come through, g-unit d one two (D12) and Obie we all move
like assasins, ski masks and gloves
consider this as a warning, disaster comes
faster than you can react to it, just ask Marx
we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch as up
We are not killas, my vato will have you shot though
drag the little body on fuck like kim osario's
little sorry-o ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source coovers like fuckin Cyrpress Hill
then in the Ninties when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, i don't smoke, but i toke
enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an O.G. you're fuckin wit a G.I. Joe
BIA BIA, MIA-MIA you livin la vida a loc?
i'm a psyhco, mariah aint got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spittin baby food on peep-
le it at San Ceedrow Ranch huddled up next to a em with hello kitty on slippers on humpin her
legs
you ever had your cap peeled back? or your shit pushed in?
I'll put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushin
slice your ear clear off, Schmirnoff and Hen dawg (hennessy)
I'll show you how to fuckin kill a man like Sin-dog
Nobody told you that i'm loco esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha. DY and it is for dees nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
i pee in a cup for 3 months, i'm having a E party
for easter, please come50 Cent:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
your name up over him, chew him up
and spit him out 
too much venom
and if you roll wit' him we gon' fuck you up wit' him
you can do all them push ups to pump up ya chest
i got a 12 gauge Marksberg to pump up ya chest
have you gaspin for air after that shell hit ya vest
fear me like you fear God cuz i bring death
silver back gorilla in the concrete jungle
i'm the strongest around, you know how i get down
i watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
turn it off before it ends because the bad guy dies
if you tryin' to buy guns from the nigga that look to
so what they got bodies on 'em they still look new
you can raise your voice like you finna touch somethin'
when i raise my knife, shit i'm finna cut somethin
they say i walk like Ron O'neil and talk like obie (obie trice)
if the bitch think i love her, well then the bitch don't know me
haha, sorry KIM (eminem's ex wife)

There's an intruder, in my house
He cut my phone-line, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout
A couple o' cocktails, will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops, hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
And a Pit Bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit, foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be
An issue when you're me and which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'mma be the wrong one
You wanna harass, with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass
Where was you at, last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms
What I'm 'posed to fight wit' bare palms
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns, we as Americans
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America and we are Americans
I make beaucoup bucks, wear beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I could've been next, to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who, with an "S" tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on, it's funny
We got a buzz spreadin' quicker than making paper airplanes out of a 20
Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said, but I said precedents
In the standards, and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, one bastard
I'm too old to go an' cruise Gratiot, fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got the fuckin Au-to-ma-tic
Ain't no one Gon' test this Mon', clack click
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
Shh, I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck 2 Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin' with the long arm or the long long gone
I'mma do five years no less than that, o questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my weed back
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

Guess who?
Did you miss me?Jessica Simpson, sing the When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac forantacid if you can
Get ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How doesit feel? Is it fantastic? Is it Grand?
Well look at all the massive masses inthe stands
Shady, man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can?
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)
Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen De
Generes
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)
Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth (blup)
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like Elvis
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can ya blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact, make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)
Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
So baby (baby)
Baby, get down, down down

Rehab never looked so good
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, wooo
Dr. Dre, two-thousand and twenty

Guess who?
Did you miss me?Jessica Simpson, sing the When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac forantacid if you can
Get ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How doesit feel? Is it fantastic? Is it Grand?
Well look at all the massive masses inthe stands
Shady, man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can?
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)
Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen De
Generes
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again

Ha-ha, wooo
Dr. Dre, two-thousand and twenty
Yeah

I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit
You gone phase me, but swingin like Peter Parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
"You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe (none)
I'm sick of this, here's my final dis
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like this"Bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget" (what they know about this?)

My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jesse
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid
You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack
Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from... yaknow what'm sayin?, that's some old Detroit shit
y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come
to my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live,
cause we shine"Bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget" (what they know about this?)

MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us
Now who the fuck are you? its just coincidental
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone
Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit"Bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget" (what they know about this?)

Shady
We're back
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
And you better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no name brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best
I'm nowhere thought up as that, not even the same league
As Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-ZYo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radio
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And they very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big b-b-big b-b-baby
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin' to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes gets better each day
Replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so
Shady
Stat Quo, we're back
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs c'mon
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves sure was a breeze
I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "Suck my dick" I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and EFolk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady
Shady
Bobby Creek, we're back
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with 'em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track
Nigga
Shady
Cashis
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death lived in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you raped in the pen like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back, nigga
Shady
Ha! I told you we was back
We're back

This the beat you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta, been bangin' the underground since 95 we're bangin
Elected to be the villain, and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled, up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you ever see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said welcome to Detroit City

Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's whats good man they all say Tricky
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on mothafuckas for the longest time
So its evident, its time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fanbase thats bigger than an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace the love
And beat the hell outta anyone that fucks with us
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome u to Detroit City

But when they say one of the best
I'm nowhere thought up as that, not even the same league
As Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-ZYo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radio
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And they very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big b-b-big b-b-baby
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin' to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes gets better each day
Replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so
Shady
Stat Quo, we're back
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs c'mon
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves sure was a breeze
I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "Suck my dick" I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and EFolk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady
Shady
Bobby Creek, we're back
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with 'em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track
Nigga
Shady
Cashis
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death lived in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you raped in the pen like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back, nigga
Shady
Ha! I told you we was back
We're back

[Eminem]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick**sounds of steps**Hey yo Stick, Stick[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah.
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah.
Well it wasn't a good. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?Verse One: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as Eminem's?
Blond hair, blue eyes
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me
(Can I get your autograph?)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)Chorus: Eminem
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if he was white?)What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white,(STICKyyyy what if you were white?) white, white,
white, white, white?Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be L-Slim right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight
(What's UP MY BROTHER?)True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?)
Is it a minfo
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if he was white?)What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white(ummmmmmmm?)
What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if he was white?)Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
Smokin on them all on a marboral
instead of a nueport
I live in Long Island
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the trees spots
'cause all the niggas trend think I was a cop
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(What would you do if you were white?)
What - If - He - Was - White?
(What if you were white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white,
(What if you were white!)
white, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
white, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?[Eminem]
Yo, what if I was White? uhh.

What's The Difference between me and you?
What's The Difference between me and you?Back when Cube was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'm a do whatever it takes to convince you'Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is everybody wanna know how close
Me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth
And we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big
To pay attention to 'em, that's the difference
What's The Difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'What's The Difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'Yo I stay with it while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's The Difference between me and you?
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left, yo that's the difference
What's The Difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
Aight, hold up hold up stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
Right, Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed, who's throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'm a sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people, then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off, drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like the Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So What's The Difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck," and see who means it

You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do

Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words, I guess...Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression
No, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
What happens when you become the main source of pain"Daddy look what I made"
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's mommy?"
"I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry"
"Why? Why is mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more"
"Daddy you're lyin'"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time"
"But you ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
"This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'"
"You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad"
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'"
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
But baby, wait!
"It's too late, dad, you made the choice"
"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
"That's what they want, they want you Marshall they keep"
"Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep"
"Just take another pill, yeah, I bet that you will"
"You rap about it"
"Yeah, word, k-k-keep it real"
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
There's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to... say
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain
Just smile back

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smoking crack?Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
You're slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of Mc
Veigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first,
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till you car spin you then
Damn!
U slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal,
When I pull up looking for you,
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night
When The Music Stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
NWA said fuck the police
Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Presilla at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
MOP had me grindy and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter

Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

America, hahaha, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech
The United States government has sworn to uphold, or so we're told
I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who woulda thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby!) Look at my sales
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like, "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn; we just swapped: sitting back, looking at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now? It's
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waiting to choke; tightening around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like I don't like this, NOPE!
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney, Fuck you Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-est of speech
This Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!
Haha, I'm just playing, America
You know I love you

America, hahaha, we love you

I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who woulda thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby!) Look at my sales
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like, "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn; we just swapped: sitting back, looking at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now? It's
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waiting to choke; tightening around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like I don't like this, NOPE!
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney, Fuck you Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-est of speech
This Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!
Haha, I'm just playing, America
You know I love you

Mic check one-two
Who woulda knew?
Who'da known?
Fuck woulda thought?
Motherfucker comes out
And sells a couple of million records
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him
Apparently you ain't parents'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week I've seen a Schwarzaneggar movie where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I see these three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin' "Go!" with their seventeen year-old uncle
I'm like "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads' who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your twelve year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And "fuck" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be if nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I'd
Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck, shit, ass, bitch, cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a teach-er
Her, him, is it you is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes
Who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it
I ain't know if you'd do it or not'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from
When you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
I don't give a fuck I don't play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
But by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
I'm selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm shittin' on competition
In the meantime it's always mean time
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
Cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs
I keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a (like a) fucking (fucking)
Echo (echo)... (Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling, here I go, I'm outta control like no
Other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Coz I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
Shit...
Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
Blow it out your ass

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie!Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch!
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me?
Well I'm back
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie!Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch!
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me?
Well I'm back
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Kids!

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see

And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?
And you can bet your stanking ass

Fork was in the road took the psychopath

Yo, the rage I release on a page
is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a f**kin stick of dynamite
Onen I get behind the mic
it's like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guidin light at night shinin bright
My f**kin grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock-suckin cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man the shit's depressin
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Swift: "Come on Slim, let's go and teach this f**kin bitch a lesson")
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up, don't you let up
one bit on these motherf**kin suckers you're a soldier +GET UP+
STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, LONG AS YOU BREATHIN
THEY JEALOUS OF YOU MAN THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY BEEFIN![Chorus][Swifty Mc

Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
from these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters
that'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm +Dirty+, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it, tell them motherf**kers Swift did it
You packin somethin special in your crib then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile (uh-huh)
with this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin up the hospital
and wouldn't give a f**k if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em[Chorus][Bizarre]
I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Eminem: Why not?) I only f**k animals (Oh! Ha-ha)
Stupid trick got my dick startin to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor!) Six times I been arrested; how would you feel
if you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens) I'm smokin dank drikin drank
I can't have any kids cause I'm f**kin shootin blanks!
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a f**k?!
Nicole's a whore - I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut (uhh!)
Responsibility - I'm negligent

Let Richard Simmons be the President (ohh HEYY!)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre

Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and
chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, but here's the
brain fuck
We the same cuz
I'm probably about to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fucking game up
Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit
Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, drive, wavy bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to baby's
Maybach
My shit is powerful, literally sick, trust me nigga
It's ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get
The more disgusting and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the champagne, I'm about the toast
I, only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you staring in your
postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back, muthafucker
Notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL
I'm back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from
the Brothers
How y'all realer? (How y'all realer?) If I said it,
I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a car dealer
Give up the throne, your lease up, I am the Mona
Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your
piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Nigga, the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me 'cause
I've got Gucci's on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk
Models in the front
Bottles in the club
But I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard
For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
I'm at a loss for words 'cause y'all already said it
all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block
Psyche!
When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site,
overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet!
Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin' a
new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie, I'm a
little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got
scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when
she witcha
When she wit' me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a sperate with a purpose, havin' problems?
Not a problem I've encountered
I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the
circus
At the fire round the circle's right in front of them,
fire rounds
Pun intended, gun extended, what are you mark's
askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past
it
Since I decided to start Class diss
All black, all glass, panoramic roof been gettin'
marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted all across the globe
from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to blocked and reported as spam
Bong! Interscope up in this dope and I sell it
My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin' inside of
envelopes
And they tryna mail 'em to me, tryna reach my
phone
I don't know which one is harder
Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my
own
I got Gucci's on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk
Models in the front
Bottles in the club
But I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard
For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
I'm at a loss for words 'cause y'all already said it
all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block
Psyche!
Man, get the bozac
We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad
flava)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck (We in
effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real
On the strength, no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on
Haters get the gasface!

Yeah, yeah
I don't know what else to say
I can't, I can't think of nothin'
I'm stumped
Here we go (Here we go)
On your feet (On your feet)
Stand up (Stand up)
Everybody hands up (Hands up)
Uh, man, I dunno, man
Everytime I go to think of something played out to
say
You already said it
I ain't calling names cause all of y'all the same,
plus
I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the
Slaughter's came up
Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and
chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you want to be saved not in a religious sense
But we have to constitute what this country? for if only children
We seem to be approachin an age of the gross (burp)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should a little better
Alright come on let's cut this bullshittin' and dub
Let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue
And open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And this whole origina
The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy on the East side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 Mile and a war and they hit territory
I'd like to share a story this is my story
And can't nobody tell it for me
I am well aware that I don't belong here
You made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn they're everywhere
From bel air shoppin' centre just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side
A day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up theyd' give me a lift up
8 Mile and van dyke I'd steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma's and charmer's
After dark to sneak me in the house
When I'm kicked out my mum's
That's about the time I first met Proof
Wed goof hed carry on the steps said I was bored handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check this out some time
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike
We was on that same shit
That big daddy kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
My first year in 9th grade
Can't forget that day in school
It was cool til' your man
MC Sham came through
And said that Puma's the brand
cause the Klan makes Troops.
It was rumors but man, goddamn they flew
Must'a been true because man we done banned they shoes,
I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too.
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they was yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted.With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X clan's tape is...
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe
So let's go back
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
As we go on another episode

Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out (whoooo!)When it's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it
It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody

Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me.
Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine
Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a f**kin' g
I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it.

Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'cause I want you to triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin' (haha!)

When me and fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out (whoooo!)When it's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it
It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's shady after-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come izzon what kinda fizz-uckin' question is that
Who run it?
You know, you actin' like you don't know.
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but actin' like you don't know
Who run it?You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but actin' like you don't know {cashis, break it down now!}
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me.
Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine
Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a f**kin' g
I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it.
We run it! You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but you actin' like you don't know

Go...

The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means "suicide" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to blogging about bologna, I'm not gonna stop
The saga continue, no stopping the force Obi, I'm mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch
And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-PLet me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't traveling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie I'll never forget you, no
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancing all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rep'So I'm gonna fuck till I die, yeah I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need 2 mics
Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyme and I bust it, and - excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process
Tryna process this loss is making me nauseous
But this depression ain't taking me hostage
I've been patiently watching this game, pacing these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'mma show them, blow them out the water slaughter them homes
I'mma own so many belts, the only place they can hit me is below them
Homie I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me "Naw, Doody you're not!" Laying on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "Think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie I'll never forget you, no
